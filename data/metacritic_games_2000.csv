What we can immediately pull away from the amazing presentation is the knowledge that a very intelligent developer named ""Barking Dog Studios"" saw the potential for the series and worked very hard to make it a better experience all around.  If anyone hasn't played Homeworld in a while, you'll remember that it had a fantastically executed story held back just a smidge by occasionally buggy fleet A.I., a killer difficulty curve after the 3rd mission, an almost unfair amount of frustration at times, and of course some cumbersome interface quirks.  This has really all been cleared up by Barking Dog, since not only have they patched and filled some of the irksome frustrations of the interface, but they've completely cleaned up the issue with unit balance as well.  Incorporating a unit cap was an incredibly good idea, it adds quite a bit more strategy in when you choose to build your units.  Though this was frowned upon as an overall game-changing mechanic, I thought it made unit preservation that much more important.  And with how much faster paced Cataclysm is compared to its predecessor- it makes a good deal of sense to implement that feature.  Without getting too much into the story, the actual flow of combat is what really drove me to enjoy this game over and over again.  The back and forth of the main factions in game are nothing short of nerve-racking.  Slowly preparing a fleet to do battle with a foe that can reverse your technology and assimilates your ships is terrifying and incredibly interesting.  Working out the balance of your fleet, researching new ways to counter your borg-like foe are all part of the campaign as well as the skirmish modes.  To mention briefly the sound design is nothing short of brilliant, its much more engaging than the original game, though some of the voice work does sound a little goofy initially, overall its very well implemented as well.  The atmospheric soundtrack is back, and though it doesn't feature anything that standouts as well as the first game, it is still very good.  The games engine itself was starting to see some gray hairs unfortunately, so of course it was polished as well as it could be for 2000.  Between the much more involved story line, the pacing of various space battle, the more efficient research and harvesting system- the game easily outdoes 1999's origin tale.  If not by design alone, it certainly features a much more engaging plot that really goes all out in conveying the urgency of stopping your mistake that was born from foolish ignorance.  If you have always wondered what the best ""sequel"" was, this is it, this is the actual ""Homeworld 2"" and their is really nothing like it inside the real time strategy genre.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/homeworld-cataclysm

Tekken Tag Tournament is the first instalment of the ""Tag"" series and brings back previous characters from the earlier Tekken games. The graphics have certainly boosted up a notch from the PS1 and Arcade versions, some of the stages are fantastic - pyramid temples, colosseum's and dojos. Gameplay is still the same as before, but there are some new fighting moves, different game modes to play and for the first time you can play as not one, but two characters in each fight. Not all characters are available to start off with, you have to unlock them in Arcade mode. Fight your way through 8 different stages by kicking, punching and wrestling each opponent and you will unlock a new character as well as a nice short theatre clip from each character you complete Arcade in. If you've played Tekken before, then most of the moves you'll know already but if you're new to the series, you may want to get some practicing done in Practice mode. You can change the difficulty settings if want to challenge yourself and become a master at the game. Of course this game wouldn't be Tekken without (my personal faviroute) multiplayer, where you and your friend can choose two different characters (4 altogether). Another new feature to this game is if you have a Multitap, you can have up to 4 players to make it even more enjoyable. You and your friends can get loads of aggressive fun, competing against one another to become the champion. If that wasn't enough for you why not play a much relaxing game of bowling, yes you heard me right bowling, something you might wanna try if you have a bad headache after all that anger and shouting from multiplayer. One thing that disappoints me is even though you can use two characters tag in each fight, the round ends after one of them is defeated rather than finish them both off. This would have been a nice option to let you configure this. Usually I would get bored of the same old repetitive fighting but it still manages to charm for the fourth time running.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/tekken-tag-tournament

I've owned this game for at least five years, and the fact that I still play it says a lot. That being said, it definitely isn't perfect, and it shows it's age.Positives: The game play is very well done. There's basically two modes, challenge mode and free mode. You can figure out what both modes contain. The tricks are very fun to pull off, even if you know most of them are not remotely possible. At the end of each session, there's a replay that you can watch. If you can put together a great looking run, watching that replay is a blast. The crash physics are way off, in a good way. Your body is a rag doll as soon as you leave the bike, so every single impossible movement you can think off will most likely happen. What really stands out is the other half of the physics, in which you can sometimes get your rider to bounce off the ground like a super ball. There's a train you can hit in the first level, and I've literally spent hours throwing myself at it to watch the results in the replay. There's also fun cheat codes, like one that makes your head spin around while riding your bike.Negatives: It's an older game, and it sure looks it. It may have been impressive in it's time, but now it's just hard to look at some things. Don't get me wrong, most textures are done pretty well. It's just that some objects look oddly stretched a bit, most noticeably at the top of ramps. Also, the things that make it fun can also make it annoying. Challenge mode has a few challenges that seem to be entirely luck based, or hampered by the so-so controls. The rag doll can be a bit of a bother at times too, such as when the body randomly spasms. It can be funny, but when your already bothered by your inability to land a trick during a timed event, the extra time wasted with the spasms can really annoy you.All in all, it's a recommended title to add to your collection.

It’s not terrible and it’s not great. It’s a third-person shooter for the Playstation 2 that puts the player in control of a squad of four operators. You can issue commands to the other three members when they are present in the missions, though it’s surprisingly rare to have all four with you at once in the game. I never found a need to even bother giving them commands, especially in the later levels where they were incapacitated within the first few gun battles and I couldn’t use them anymore. Essentially you’re playing the game by yourself and sometimes if the AI Squad is around, they may shoot a few enemies for minimal damage. The level designs are very repetitive in the missions, all of them boiling down to following some corridors, gun fight in large room, find switches to open doors, repeat until you reach the boss. The story is extremely simple, borderlining on being unfinished. The cutscenes between the missions sometimes just sound like voice actors reading lines that could have been placed anywhere in the game and have no connection to what is actually going on. It’s all just a means to connect the levels together. There is also a corner-peeking mechanic where you can lean out to shoot enemies, however, this quickly becomes useless because the more dangerous enemies carry grenade launchers and rockets which detonate when hitting the corner, resulting in damaging your character as well. I found it much easier to actually just run-and-gun and strafe into rooms holding the trigger down. All this being said, it’s not a bad game at all. It’s actually a competent shooter with some unique mechanics (for its time, it was a PS2 launch title) in place to earn points in the missions and buy new weapons and gear between them, giving you a sense of accomplishment and choice. The game isn’t terribly long, clocking in around 4-5 hours but this is actually for the better, since as mentioned above, the levels aren’t very unique from each other and the length feels right in terms of not fatiguing the player with repetition. The game can be difficult at certain points and feel a bit cheap when you turn corners to immediately get hit by rocket launchers but there is a decent Checkpoint system that doesn’t force to much backtracking and the enemies are very generous with ammo drops after being killed. All in all, X Squad is a serviceable Playstation 2 game. It will likely be hard to try and play at this point if you’ve never spent any real time with a Playstation 2 and that era of gaming but for those who are looking to explore the catalogue of games and don’t mind the dated graphics, difficulty spikes and bland story, it’s worth a nostalgic visit.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/x-squad

In short word this game is pure trash!A game released on PC and PlayStation by Konami. The game's story line takes place during the first 30 or 40 minutes from the film during the arrival to Hamunaptra and the awakening of the mummy. Now, it is a short game... like 2 hrs or 2:30, but still short with a mix difficulty but this difficulty came from the terrible controls that the PC port has, the game's design is very terrible with horrible graphics, even for a game released in the 2000's, boring gameplay which is only explore tombs and shot mummies in third person with some limited ammo.In my opinion, i felt it like a kind of Tomb Raider game... but based on a film and instead of playing as Lara Croft you play as a terrible model that kind-of looks like Brendan Fraser.A good point that this game has is that the atmosphere felt somehow dreadful with some spooky noises that the mummies make, they even are a bit scary to fight, they can handle way to many bullets to the point that you run of ammo, but they're not impossible to kill, using melee weapons can do the job done.Overall is a pretty ""FUGLY"" game...",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/the-mummy
