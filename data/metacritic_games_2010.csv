Rock Band 3 innovates that game in nearly every way possible and includes nearly all features that fans have requested for years.The biggest innovations are the addition of keys and Pro Mode.  Keys(a 2.5 octave midi keyboard that can be played sitting or as a keytar) adds the last traditional rock instrument to the mix.  With keys and harmony vocals(as first seen in The Beatles Rock Band) you can now have up to 7 players simultaneously rocking out.  Pro Mode is Harmonix's response to the ever present question, ""Why don't you just learn to play real instruments.""  Playing Pro Mode on Expert, that is exactly what you're doing.  You're playing the actual guitar, bass, drum, and keyboard parts.While not as flashy, the new song management system is crucial for Rock Band players with hundreds of songs in their collection.  Also handy is the ability to save custom playlists.  The song selection is a great mix of classic hits, new stuff, and deep cuts. The only cons I can see:1. A few songs from RB1 and RB2 won't transfer into the RB3 library.2. Gone are crowd-singalongs for RB3 on-disc songs.3. To get the full Rock Band experience you need to spend a lot of money to get a pro guitar, keys, drum cymbals, and all the great DLC that is available.

Originally released in Japanese arcades in the Fall of 2008, the original Tatsunoko vs. Capcom moved to the Wii console on December 11, 2008. This fighter blends these two rich universes by taking Capcom characters like Ryu from Street Fighter, Morrigan from Darkstalkers and the giant PTX-40A from Lost Planet and putting them against Tatsunoko fan-favorite characters from Gatchaman, Hurricane Polymar, Casshern and more. It’s a battler oyale that delivers match-ups that only exist in fans wildest dreams!

The Assist feature adds another compelling element found Capcom’s other VS series: allowing players to switch their character on the fly or call for help from their tag-team partner, allowing for spectacular super moves (Hyper Variable Combination). Successful execution of the Assist feature can turn the tide of battle on a dime. Historically the VS series excels in integrating the tag-team options by including customized moves like Variable Assist, Snapback, and the previously mentioned Hyper Variable combination that lets both characters on one team perform their Hyper attack. TvC enhances the above gameplay with new mechanics, including the Variable Aerial Rave that allows characters to be switched in the middle of an Aerial rave. More moves include the offensive Assault and defensive maneuver Mega Crash. Another new gameplay mechanic, titled Baroque, illuminates the character in a rainbow of colors, cancels the current attack and extends combos and damage.

Gamers can use offensive and defensive attacks as they battle for the lead and careen through real-world track locations ranging from L.A. and San Francisco to the streets of Hackney, UK and the treacherous roads of Barcelona, Spain. Beyond the action-packed racing filled with fast curves, sneaky alternate routes, hair-raising jumps and fully realized damage models that provide for spectacular crashes, Blur’s narrative is presented through Bizarre’s new community-based interface, reaching far beyond the game itself. This unique story-driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in-game and in real life. Looking beyond Blur's single player story, gamers can engage in competitive and team-based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online, or on a single console via 4-player split-screen. Bizarre has also introduced Blur’s original social gaming experience - Custom Groups, where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favorite ways to play the game. These new modes are immediately shared through Blur’s social network, expanding the game in ways that are only limited by the gaming community’s creativity.

I also have been an MMA Participant/Fan since the Beginning! I have Played everything from UFC on Dreamcast, Tapout 1 & 2 on XBOX, UFC Sudden Impact & PRIDE FC on PS2, Throwdown on Nintendo GameCube, UFC Undisputed 2009/2010 & NOW EA MMA on 360! That was Not meant to be a BragFest but rather a recap of Where My Opinions/Comparisons come from! The Original DreamCast UFC was, of course, the GroundBreaker that Started it all! UFC 2009, to me, was The BEST MMA game to Date! 2010 Seemed like a Rushed (to beat EA to release!) Cash grab and NOT Much More than a Roster Update with Few Real Notable changes. The Event Mode being the Most memorable & my personal Favorite.    Now for EA MMA!: First off if they would have named it something like ""EA Sports Presents MMA Featuring StrikeForce!"" there Might be LESS complaints about ""where are the UFC guys?""! Maybe! From the beginning I Too did Not give much chance for EA's MMA title. Like a Lot of Fellow gamers I  fell into the ""If it doesn't have the More Well Known UFC Fighters It will Probably Not be as Good!"" category! I am GLAD to say I was Wrong there! There are So Many Exclusive fighters that are as good or Better than their UFC counterparts In there own respective weight classes! There are also Very Extensive Fighter Creation/Share tools (They are Far Superior to THQ UFC's current version!) that Offer NEAR Perfect UFC Clones! For those Longing for Dream matches like Brock Lesnar vs Fedor Emelianenko Here is the Place to get it! Well this is as Close as we can get for now at least! There are also other Various COOL  Options to keep fights from getting stale. Venue Locations, Ring Types (Round, Boxing & Of Course Octagonal) Plus being able to set Rule types are a Nice and Refreshing change of pace! I haven't jumped into the Career mode so I can't comment on that Yet. I feel compelled to voice my concern and comment that ONLY EA can Tank (No. Not Paul Abbot!) its MMA Game at this point by Pulling the Online support like it has done with a Lot of its other Franchises! For MMA and just Fighting Game Fans alike EA Sports MMA is the BEST way to put a Digital BeatDown on/with your friends! I feel the Competition here Is a Good thing! Look at how Tekken, Soul Calibur & Street Fighter and Forza & Gran Turismo Push each other to improve! THQ and EA can continue to Pour quality features into their Games! In the end we win! Like Arcade Style Fighting, Racing Games etc... I have NO problem owning 2 MMA games. IF they are Both well made & are each worth having!    My reviews tend to be scatterbrained! For that I apologize. My Main goal is to Help Fellow gamers that are fans of the Same genre be able to enjoy quality games! This Also put a BullsEye on me for tweens & Other ADHD FOOLS to Jab at MY Review Instead of My Online Fighter! Keep in mind witty review Blasters: My review does NOT Hit Back.

You'll see yourself engaged in their hard and time-consuming tasks like paying the rent, bills, take care of a son or a cat, eating, addictions, dealing with people and their own problems. You'll be challenged everyday to manage their time at work, travel, and common tasks. Earning money is a constant concern, and it will be very hard. Meantime (a very scarce time) you have to know your new city, what you can get at local stores, for how much, and what you can get to improve your business. To get a life, to be happy and healthy, not just to survive, and you will be concerned by your character in a sad, depressive way. Cart Life is not an easy game on any aspect.It takes me 10hs just to have a relatively good ending with a single of the three characters.Although the description like ""a retail simulator"" is true, don't expect so much depth about it. The mechanics are very simple - sometimes dull - and most of the time you'll struggle with them. It's not a game design issue, but a perceived and mostly well-done attempt to reproduce the boring and mechanical aspects of a simple work. About bugs.I had some difficulty to put the game to work, and the single author doesn't give us any support or patches. I still getting very rare crashes (like 2 or 3 in 10 hours). But some things i saw people complaining doesn't seem like bugs to me, like the cash register refusing to open sometimes, or realizing you have no change, and you'll lose your customer. I saw these things perfectly fitting the game purpose, and i think most people will see them like bugs because of the random aspect of the game, or the absence of a good AI. So, every time you open your cash register this random aspect will define how much money it have inside, and you can see the same customer many times on a single day. The art style is fabulous for those who had an MSX or similar by the 80's, and although we had not mouses at this time, the gameplay is very closer, sometimes dull like i said before.

The writing is hilarious and quick-witted, and is the main allure of this game (at least to me). There are quests absolutely everywhere.

The answer to that are your personal preferences, since there are a lot of great things in the game, but also things that will anger you till you tilt, especially because you will - at that point - know that the game has a huge potential which seems to be not used. The PROs include The best fighting system there is. You are in control of your attacks and blocks, the direction, the timing, the distance and the speed. The fights are intense.Amazing battles sizes not only in the singleplayer, but also on the multiplayer. No not only 64 as falsely proclaimed in many reviews, there are servers that offer room for up to 222 players. The Singleplayer mode is in Vanilla limited to 150, but by using the MBW Battle Resizer the only limitation is your hardware. I play with a battle size of 700.The SP world. Kingdoms rise and fall with or without your doing. This war-torn country of Calradia does not need a player to function :-D.The multiplayer. You will hate it for crushing you (I have no clue how so many people can be so good). You will love it for the excitement, the rush of adrenaline when being faced by a group of enemies, the joy of making a kill - finally, and the tactical thinking.A great community. It is a must for anybody buying this game, to use the forum. Otherwise you will never get the full potential out of this game. The Mods are the true jewels here. More on that later.The developers put a lot of effort into fixing bugs and improving the game. Since the release in March there have been 6(!) official patches i know of, that fixed bugs, rebalanced weapons, added new game features, etc. . The game was playable from the beginning, it just got better.The CONsThe singleplayer lacks a tutorial. The game is very complex and especially the character creation is too complex for newbies. Later on you will be happy for the amount of choices tho. A mission to start off with was added, which helps a little on getting into the game.No big questline. You can roleplay the squat out of this game, but you will have to create your story yourself.At some point the game becomes repetative. Its after getting started, gaining power and before starting your own kingdom. Overall the Vanilla Singleplayer is missing something to keep it interesting.Sieges are the biggest flaw in Vanilla SP. The AI sucks here and the possible choices - really opposing the general game theme - are basically nonexistent. It is a pity that the multiplayer siege options werent implemented into the SP.The conclusion:The Vanilla game has highs and lows. 30 Bucks is acceptable for it, but its not a great deal.HOWEVER Mount and Blade: Warband is a long term investment. This is due to the huge modding community of the game (Forum!). You dont like the graphics? Get Polished Landscapes. You dont like the Battlesize? Get a Resizer. You dont like time period? Download a total conversion, which plays in the Renaissance or WW2. There are even mods solely dedicated to the Multiplayer. F.E. You dont like to always have to choose from the same troops and equipment? You want to customize your character? You want to change your skills? Get the CRPG mod and play it on their servers, which hold up to 120 spots for players. This ever growing amount of mods add amazing things to the Multiplayer and the Singleplayer and thats why the game is in my opinion worth the buy. You will get not only 1 game, but you will get a growing number of games. Therefore a tip of my hat to Taleworlds and their modding community.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/mount-blade-warband

Three types of missiles are at your disposal, each one with its own characteristics - but all of them can bounce off walls on their path to smash, blast or drill through enemies and blocks. Along the way, you'll find item blocks just waiting to be destroyed so that you can obtain special power-ups ... and cause even more destruction. Be careful though, as missile type and position are predetermined and you get only a limited number of launches per stage. Complete multiple classes containing numerous individual stages, earning medals when you clear stages in fewer than the given number of turns.

I gave up on it all though after Ultimate Spider-Man.There was a gleaming light of hope however when this gem was announced. Gone is the repetitive free roam style, and Spidey returns to real, level by level gaming (or in this case, split up in Acts). You play as four different Spider-Men after the Amazing Spider-Man shatters the Tablet of Order & Chaos, a mystical relic that apparently grants great powers to evil minded villains (even when only in pieces), in a scuffle with Mysterio. This begins Spidey's journey to recover the tablet shards and restore order before these villains dish out complete havoc. The storyline is basic, and doesn't change from start to finish, which I personally don't mind, I'd prefer an overly-simple story over an overly-complex one (which most comic books and games in general do now-a-days), so I suppose it's a breath of fresh air to not get any dumb plot twists and other stupid things of that nature.The graphics are pleasing to the eyes, looking they were torn straight out of the comic book pages and onto our televisions. Every dimension (Amazing, 2099, Noir, Ultimate) has a unique look and feel to it. Amazing looks just like the comic books, 2099 is very bright with lots of lights and flashing, Noir is very dark and mysterious (the sky looks awesome, just thought I'd mention that), and Ultimate looks pretty much just like the Ultimate comic (probably the more lackluster of the three since the Amazing universe does that too). Gameplay is where this game shines. Each universe has a different gameplay style, from the Noir stealth, to the crazy free-falling 2099. Amazing and Ultimate are a bit more on the normal side though, but that doesn't make them any less enjoyable to play through. Each stage has a lot of variety, and plenty of nooks and cranny's to explore for Spider-Emblems, and Hidden Spiders (which give you more Spider Essence to purchase upgrades). There's plenty to do in this game, due to the Web of Destiny, which is a series of challenges or goals that you must do to unlock the entire web. As you unlock more challenges, you gain access to more of Spidey's special moves and new costumes, so you don't want to ignore these. Some of them are inevitably unlocked (such as defeating a boss, etc), but a lot of them are not, and you won't want to ignore them. I also must mention that zipping around the stages couldn't be easier with the easy to learn control scheme, and beating the crap out of enemies is a real pleasure too. There's also the first person view brawl scenes with the bosses, which I thought were weird thing to add at first, but it grew on me very fast. The camera has its problems I suppose, though to be honest I've only had issues with it when I'm wall crawling, which I rarely do anyway.The sound is great, notably due to the amazing voice actors of the Spider-Men and their foes. A lot of classic Spidey VA's are here, with funny lines and witty phrases being spout at every corner. It was a trip down memory lane for me, hearing Noir Spidey in particular, since I loved the 90's animated series, though I'm sure others will be partial to other VA's. The music isn't memorable, but that doesn't mean it's bad either. It gets the job done, to say the least. I particularly enjoy the music of 2099 and the Noir universes. I'm guessing by this point it's obvious that my two favorite dimensions are those two, since I continually mention them with praise.This game is a must buy for Spidey fans, and fans of the action genre, or just plain anyone that's into a good game. There's a lot of potatoes with the meat with the Web of Destiny, 3 difficulty levels, rankings, and alternate costumes, so there's a lot of reason to go back and continue playing (probably more than the reasons I mentioned here). This is a great direction for Spidey, and I hope Activision keeps Beenox on board for their next Spider-Man release.

Dante sets out on a rescue mission to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself. Players take Dante through nine unique circles of Hell as mapped out and described by Alighieri: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. Each circle showcases its own distinct look, with demons, monsters, damned and geography that are crafted straight from the poem's vivid descriptions. To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they'll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell's fiercest beasts and bosses.

Frankly, watching people playing Rock games at parties, I always thought that a great Hip-hop game would be a better party fit.    Enter Def Jam Rapstar.   This is perhaps the most fun party game I've ever played.   Hands down.    I broke it out at a party this past weekend, and within minutes, the whole room was going nuts.   The music in the game is great - and seemed to appeal much better to men and women.   But it was the camera component that really had people going.   I don't know why, but once people realized that they were on camera, and we could edit the videos and then watch how good (or better put, how bad) we were, it took it to a whole different level.    We played the game for hours and couldn't have had a better time - battling, duets....and mostly just making crazy videos.And while that was fun, seeing the videos online the following morning was almost better.   Friends who weren't with us that night  were flat out jealous that they'd missed one of the best nights in recent memory.   Maybe this was just our experience, but if what I experienced is any indicator, I think Def Jam Rapstar is going to go down as one of the best party games ever made.

It is definitely a difficult game, but I keep coming back for more because of the addicting simplicity of it, combined with the brilliant soundtrack.This is honestly the most casual of the Bit.Trip games. You can just take it easy and blast everything out of existence without much trouble on the first several levels, though boss fights are challenging (enough). The powerups are excellent, and I feel like this is the most rewarding of all the Bit.Trip games when it comes to replay value. Unless you dislike challenging games, I strongly recommend this one",https://metacritic.com/game/wii/bittrip-fate

There were a few minor problems with motion controls and the camera was a bit crazy at times.

It, at first, looks like a cheap attempt by Sega to cash in on nostalgia-charmed Sonic fans under the guise of a reboot. That first impression being strengthened particularly by the fact that they've done with before with 2006's ""Sonic The Hedgehog"" and the popular opinion of Sonic as a franchise has exponentially worsened after ""Sonic Adventure 2"". Even the more appreciated 2D handheld games have been maligned by hardcore fans for lacking in terms of level design and actually well designed platform segments. So ""Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1"" has quite a lot to prove by just being a Sonic game, let alone baring direct ties to the beloved original trilogy of classic Genesis titles.Here's the cool thing, the game is great. The first thing it's easy to see that the new installment of Sonic gets right is possibly the most important to the franchise, level design. The multi-tier'd levels, containing several levels of intertwined verticality with alternate paths, containing hidden items, or speed benefits are back in full effect. Gone are the bottomless pits and poorly placed enemy's that don't give you enough time to react of the Sonic Advanced series. Each level in Sonic 4 has been painstakingly crafted in expert detail and then some; with nice little touches like the flying cards in the second act of the casino zone. I've heard people argue that the control's are bad, these people are wrong, flat out. One common point in this side of the argument is that sonic controls too slow. I can only imagine that this is coming from the somewhat prolonged time it takes Sonic to reach top speed. This point is wrong for three reasons: 1. You can tap ""A"" or ""B"" twice at all times to get a quick run, reaching top speed within fractions of a second. 2. Sonic's momentary slow pace isn't new to the series it's been there since the first game, for a very important reason. 3. The important reason being, you need that slow starting speed for the more intense platforming segments in the game to be playable. On some of the more skill-based alternate path's the platforming can get pretty intense. Imagine trying to make those precise jumps while Sonic is immediately sliding all over the place at top speed! It'd be impossible. The other common point is that the, newly added, homing attack ruins the challenge of the enemy's. Which were never challenging to begin with, since enemies in Sonic game's never really amount to more than obstacles to be rolled on or jumped over.The reality of ""Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1"", is that it's the best Sonic game in a long time. Not only that, but it can stand proud next to the best games the Series has to offer. Aside from nailing the level design and controls, it also has great music and terrific looking backgrounds. People will dismiss Sonic 4 because it's not cool to like modern Sonic games. However, those people will be missing out on one of the most stunning return's to form the gaming world has ever seen.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-episode-i

Dante sets out on a rescue mission to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself. Players take Dante through nine unique circles of Hell as mapped out and described by Alighieri: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. Each circle showcases its own distinct look, with demons, monsters, damned and geography that are crafted straight from the poem's vivid descriptions. To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they'll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell's fiercest beasts and bosses. If successful, Dante will be able to tame certain beasts, exacting their will and turning Hell’s punishments back on itself. [Electronic Arts]",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dantes-inferno

If you are a History buff/Strategy buff... fan of Medieval crap... you will love this game.  The companion game: Crusaders, Thy Kingdom Come (Longass, Superfluous Title), was released before this game and is concerned with the 1st Crusades... this game involves the 3rd Crusades.  (2nd Crusades barely happened, embarrassing and not game-worthy; youd lose in the second level, per historical accuracy).  But this game is an awesome and unique strategy.  In the older, first installment, you get to choose 1 of 5 heroes to play as with unique traits and abilities to apply; depending on the faction you support most in-game you will get between 1 or even 2 sub-heroes with the same principles.  (There are fun, interactive Political elements to these games).  Everything levels, get abilities and skill points to apply, everything; men and heroes. This game contains the same principle, although you are stuck playing Richard The Lionhearted (or Saladin if you play Saracen campaign).  But regardless, you still can earn sub-heroes through political achievements or even through different sub-missions or choice-options after defeating a province.  This game also adds MORE and new RPG elements to the game... in the form of permanent buff-giving Elixirs or useable Potions, Weapons and Armor that you find (for units).  For heroes you use Holy items that grant military buffs. Theres endless combinations of how you can conquer the map through chosen territories/rewards, unit purchasing/upgrading/building...   if you ARE a strategy whore like myself you will love this game.  Especially a meticulous one.  There are MULTIPLE ways to win, as I said, especially through tactics and the men you decide to incorporate and use... especially depends on which battle-plan for which kingdom you decide to go with. The Saracens were also super-fun (although way HARDER).  They ARE different.  Base units... relatively the same... mid-late game units, completely different.  Saracens use more tricks and speed generally and rely on attack power or hit and run while Crusaders rely on a few more formations (such as Shield Wall which is exclusive to Westerners) and generally heavier units.  So there is a fun trade-off and a DISTINCTION between sides.  (Which in most strategies THERE IS NOT... just different colors or skins or 1 trait/unit).  You can use HEAVY Cavalry to also trample by holding the mouse button down and clicking a direction BEHIND the enemy ground-unit.  You can make them engage after or even do it again after they overshoot.  But Heavy Cav can also take damage if they do this... depending on Heavy Infantry (and their possible abilities) or SPEARMEN in formation (the result being the trample working... yet you are going to lose a lot of Cav, depending on circumstances).  THIS IS WHY THE GAME IS GOOD.  It is not a Micro-manage hack-and-slash... its not going to bore the **** out of you in the typical Strategy Game manner.  (Which is how most Strategies have become..).  There are just meticulous details about units or gear or formations or TERRAIN USEAGE... everything.  You can make units move in typical march speed or you can make them double-time/charge (which will use their stamina faster).  Lighter units move easier/quicker, drain less, fight better on rough terrain or in woodland... Heavies... the opposite.  So yet again more cool strategic elements to consider.  If Unit A send 2 groups of infantry against Unit Bs, 1 in the same direction, (colliding), Unit A will attack better obviously being greater in strength... BUT, the 2 groups will cram 1 behind the other... fighting far less efficiently as every single man in a group of 26/48 total will fight 1 on 1(or in formation as 1, such as a Wedge); but if A meets B with each, 1 group... then A sends his 2nd group around and BEHIND Bs 1 infantry... creating a sandwich, you will take Bs group out twice as fast as each man in Bs company is surrounded entirely.  This was an EXAMPLE of how the games fighting works between men.  Pretty realistic!  Not just, A and B collide face to face... guy with more men wins.  Unit types will also have a great effect depending on what versus what.   If you took Light Infantry on open field and sandwiched Heavy Infantry (their direct counter) then you might slay MORE Heavies then you would otherwise... but you might also lose both groups entirely anyway.  So this is essentially how it works. There is a little bit of trading on the Crusader side in mini-choices/missions as far as Gear is concerned for men... but most of the junk you find (weapons/armors/potions) are found in missions on other groups with colored/glowing banners (you have to eliminate that company to earn the item off them theyre carrying).  There is also a wide variety of items too.  The game has an economical system as well.  Loans, selling, buying... just about anything.  Men to items.  I highly recommend this game!",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/lionheart-kings-crusade

Dante sets out on a rescue mission to save Beatrice, but he soon realizes he is also in Hell to face his own demons and ultimately to redeem himself. Players take Dante through nine unique circles of Hell as mapped out and described by Alighieri: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud and treachery. Each circle showcases its own distinct look, with demons, monsters, damned and geography that are crafted straight from the poem's vivid descriptions. To take down the demons of Hell, Dante is outfitted with two primary weapons: the Scythe he takes from Death and the Holy Cross given to him by Beatrice, which has spiritual powers that will help Dante collect souls and spells from the creatures he defeats on his journey. The game also features a deep upgrade system so gamers can customize their abilities to their specific gameplay style, something they'll need as Dante comes face to face with Hell's fiercest beasts and bosses. If successful, Dante will be able to tame certain beasts, exacting their will and turning Hell’s punishments back on itself. [Electronic Arts]",https://metacritic.com/game/psp/dantes-inferno

Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: reach a particular length with your tentacles or grow them to the greatest length possible. In either mode, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies known as goobugs by touching them. There's just one catch: Successfully absorbing a goobug depends on matching its color to your tentacle. Also, longer tentacles can more easily come in contact with incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force), and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the restorative heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. With atmospheres ranging from peaceful to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels. Victory can only be achieved through quick, precise movement and the ability to remain calm under pressure. Are you ready to take on the goobugs?

However this is a plus to me. As one review said, real dancers will really like this game. Many of the routines are complex and it takes practice and multiple attempts to master. You won't breeze through with an A on the first try, but in a couple you'll get the hang and soon you'll master it.Plus, Singstar Dance's Poker Face routine slaughter's Kinect's clap-and-fist-pump routine.For people that aren't great dancers you'll still have fun and there are easier routines, but others you may not want to venture off of ""easy"" anytime soon (PCD's Don't Cha, for example).This is a great game and I'm really happy I picked it up. The reviews were too harsh but I can see their complaints, flash cards or more breakdowns would have helped.

The story-line is strong, reminded me of old films, yet could have been expanded on for longer game play.

For the first time in a sports game, this mix of technology, biology and tenacious attitude is turning the gridiron of past, full of canned animations and repetitious gameplay, into a dangerous form of self expression. Every unique tackle in the world of Backbreaker is an artistic exercise in hard hits and athletic skill. It's time to show your friends just how painful art can be. Through a combination of biology and robotics research, euphoria uses the CPU power of next-generation consoles to simulate the nervous system, muscles, and biomechanics of the football players in real-time. This is the first time this technology is being employed for a sports game. While conventional football games can only load a finite number of animations from a disc, Backbreaker's real-time technology will never allow the gameplay to become stale. Forget about prim and proper, Backbreaker presents a fast-paced, gritty gameplay experience that's more Burnout than Madden. [NaturalMotion]",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/backbreaker

A cool gimmick is that you can play the entire game using a classic visual style that replicates the garish colour palate and pixellated goodness of the NES original, complete with chiptune soundtrack. It is a wonderful addtion to be able to play the game this way, though I stuck to the updated visuals for my first playthrough. The music is also insanely catchy, original or remixed version, and will stick in your head for days to come. Much like the absolutely awesome Spelunky, Spelunker HD dumps your little explorer in a cavernous environment filled with danger. The caves you explore are completely different from those seen in the original games, so seasoned experts of those games will have a whole new world to explore. The usual assortment of cave dwelling critters are out to get you, as well as some unusual choices such as hopping lizard things and swooping birds (I didn't realise eagles lived in caves). As well as living beasts, you also have to contend with the undead. A ghost will appear every now and then, signified by the music changing to a spooky melody, and will float towards you from a random side of the screen. To temporarily banish him you must use your hand fan (yes, really) to blow him away. It looks more like the Ghostbusters' proton pack so let's pretend it's one of those as that is far cooler. The ghost can come in different sizes, taking longer to evaporate in massive form, and can also split into multiple smaller ghosts. Needless to say he is a pain in the hole. If you have played Spelunky then you will be familiar with the concept (and if you haven't then I demand you stop reading this and go do so immediately), but Spelunker on NES did it first. You also have limited oxygen, which depletes at a steady rate, and can only be topped up by collecting energy items. These are positioned fairly regularly so as long as you don't hang around too long you should be OK. Bombs and flares can also be collected, the former for blasting away rocks that block your path, or secret walls, and the latter for firing into the air to scare away  bats, and the irritating swooping birds. Keys are the most important pickup as each coloured key unlocks the corresponding door, and finding them all is mandatory. The end level checkpoint, a golden statue, is locked behind multiple doors and so you will have to explore every inch of each stage to locate the required keys. Thankfully the stages, while large, aren't too confusing, and if you do get a little lost, there is always the minimap at the bottom right of the screen to assist you. Your worst enemy in Spelunker HD is actually yourself, more precisely your jump. Yes, the irritating cheap deaths of the original remain here and sure, I died many times after slipping off an edge or jumping from too great a height, and it was annoying, but it is much easier on you than the 80's classic. There is a handy rope assist option that means you cannot fall from ropes by accidentally holding left or right while climbing (believe me, in the original this happened a lot!). So you make your way through the caves, collecting keys, avoiding enemies, steaming holes, pitfalls, rolling boulders, cascading water and more, trying to locate the statue. After 10 levels you finish the area and move onto another, with a different backdrop and new enemies. It is always exciting to reach a new set of stages, complete with new hazards and enemies out for your blood. Spelunker constantly throws surprises at you throughout its entirety, and you really get the feeling that you are descending into the unknown. Spelunker HD is a damn enjoyable game. Once you get used to the limitations set by the game and don't jump off ladders and platforms willy-nilly, as comes naturally after years of playing more forgiving platformers, you can engross yourself in the depths and really start to enjoy the exploration. In fact I can safely say it is one of the most playable platformers I have experienced for a long time. I came to Spelunker HD expecting the worst, but was absolutely blown away by how enjoyable it is and, equally, baffled by why it has receieved such negative press. I strongly urge you to ignore all these misguided reviews you have read and purchase it immediately. If you love it as much as I do then feel free to comment here  shower me with gifts.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/spelunker-hd

There are hints of Age of Wonders, smatterings of Civilization 4, a bit of Galactic Civilizations, among others. The list of things that this game does right is too long, so let me just say this: this game is fun, if you are into the genre. I played a bit of the campaign mode to learn how to play, and I had picked up the concepts and whatnot within the first 100 turns. I then started a 'sandbox' style game, played long enough to lose a moderate force to a goody hut and tried to load an autosave and the game crashed. So now I am writing a review. The GUI needs patching in this game, several times I noticed stuff from behind the book window thing superimposed with it, nothing major. It SEEMS to me that the game WILL need patching, and if you happened to pirate it, you will not be getting the patch for quite some time, since it is a Stardock game ( you have to patch it with their steamoid Impulse software thingy.)

There are many countries to choose from, which on paper, gives this game some replay value. However each country starts with their own pros and cons, many of which are low troop numbers meaning if someone randomly decides to attack you in the beginning of the game you are screwed. Each month you have a few options based upon what type of affairs are going on, Human affairs, taxes, ect. You have no direct control over what the next month will be and the game usually puts two fighting month back to back, meaning you will have no troops to fend off the second wave of attackers. In the tax month you can buy and sell the various currencies and accurate predictions of high and low values will bring more money, you can also manage troops in this month. WARNING HERE IS THE REAL PROBLEM WITH THE GAME, you are not allowed to manage troops on any month other than tax months, meaning if you get a new general, or you loose a bunch of troops, you will have to wait about three months to half a year (three to six turns) to do anything about it. Battle is simple yet complicated. You can only have three generals on the field, each gen has their own attribute, melee, defensive, or magic. Melee beats magic, magic beats defensive and defense beats melee. Unfortunately there is more luck involved than skill as you must guess what the enemy generals are, and half the time it doesn't matter cause you will lose for some unknown reason any ways, I lost a fight where I had 1,200 troops on my side (that's max, 400 troops a general) and they had 400, I still lost. One group can't move through another and in the heat of battle you will forget this and your troops will come to a halt and sit mere INCHES away from helping your other troops. The graphics are good, the story is slow and only advances as you fight other nations.

Give it a go with friends in coop and most probably you will enjoy the game. A score between 7'2 and 7'8 seems fair to me. I'm giving it an 8 for the sake of rounding. Breakdown: If you are reading this by 2019 o later, here is what you will find in Pure Football. Technically, it is an unpolished game. Graphics are cartoonish, that helps with aging. But framerate is a bit low for this level of graphic complexity, has some blurry definition, and color palette is not the most appealing. Had the game had another 2-3 months of development, results could have been notably better in this matter. Now, if you can pass through these entry barriers, inside you will find a cool football/soccer arcade gameplay that can hook you for quite some time. Not to mention the massive potential for couch coop: up to 4 players in the same team is delirious. Just the addition of another gamer to your team will boost fun by 2x, worth trying. The game might be a bit easy, so go ahead and check hard and very hard difficulty for more challenging matches. Game has only like 20 teams including unlockables, based on national teams with a range of 8 to 12 of their best players represented (apart from Brazil that, for some licensing reason I assume, have real but not first-row players). You can also unlock classic players in story mode by fulfilling some challenges and missions. There is a player editor that lets you create some new players (not too many). Also, there is a team editor that lets you create new squads from the basic and unlocked players. You might achieve filling this teams with players from a real club, hence becoming a comprehensive entity to play against (for instance, you can create Real Madrid, since Cristiano Ronaldo, Benzema, Xabi Alonso, Luka Modric, Ramos, Pepe, Casillas and so are available in the game). Almost forgot to mention a really nice feature: custom music using the standart XMB built-in PS3 music player! Just boot the game, press PS button, head to music, pick an album or setlist, and off you go! My first review here, after years of visiting this place :).

The game lacks polish, but is far better then the critic reviews suggest (in terms of polish that is) The gameplay is strange for a fighting game, the characters can run about rather than being restricted to the common 2d plane of other, but the characters are always facing eachother and the camera moves with the characters so it feels quite awkward at first. When you start thinking you're getting the hang of it either you or or opponent does a powerful attack, which causes the camera to invert behind your opponent while it does slow motion effects, and then you're back to square one, and trying to get the camera back on your side where it belongs proves quite tedious indeed. The control scheme is very simple, yet provides challenge and strategy, it's perfect for both hardcore fighting fans and newcomers. There aren't 60-move long lists for every character that you have to memorize, only about 4, and even then there aren't complicated button combos to execute, you simply press a button and a direction on the dpad and each direction has it's own move for each character, and then there's a basic press A 3 times or A twice then B, it's really simple, but still requires strategy as each character has certain attributes (x character is fast while y character is powerful, etc.) and you can even equip other characters' weapons to different characters, adding to the mixture! And on top of that you can add a magical effect of a variety of choices to the weapons, complex, yet so simple! It does sound nice on paper, yes, but unfortunately it isn't as well executed ingame. You'll notice that the motion controls are really clunky and unwieldy, you'll think it's a quick fix by switching to the convenient classic controller option, and yes, it does play much better with that, but then you notice that hit detection is inaccurate at usually the worst of times. and with the ever revolving camera it proves to be quite a challenge just to maneuver for the first few rounds. At random times a stage hazard will attack you and your opponent, and you both have to try and avoid said hazard via quick time event. At first this seems cool, but it becomes a mere distraction later on, a rather annoying one. The basic mechanics work, but it's leaving so much to be desired for expansion and polishing, it's a crime that this game doesn't have a sequel to correct and perfect the foundation this game has left, and believe me, it's a pretty solid foundation. The Story is excellent, but not because it's well written or deep and complex or anything, in fact, it's quite the opposite. This game's story is very nostalgic towards those who grew up with very non serious fighters like MK and Primal Rage and other such classic fighting games that were parodies or just ludicrous. I never grew up with those, but this game's characters and plot are so bare but so ridiculously written that you'll want to see each character's ending because of the lunacy. It's definitely better than the mind-numbingly boring and cheesy and cliched stories of most fighting games today, that's for sure. I myself have only played as two characters as of yet (Bast and Narcia, with the the former being my favorite so far) but that's not a problem considering the 10 character roster, and I can't wait to play as the rest. Characters' lines before and after fights are deliberately cheesy and are some of the greatest one-liners and taunts ever in a fighting game (""You can't beat me! I'm rich!"") and and the fact that the roster is full of Greco-Roman era creatures and such (and more) the characters in themselves are vastly more likeable than the textbook cliche and racist portrayal characters that the fighting genre has become infamous for. The visuals are great as well, don't expect visual treats like Nintendo's own work, but I have yet to see another 3rd party game on Wii that match this game's detail (well, maybe Monster Hunter comes close)  skin glistens, textures don't hurt your eyes (I'm looking at YOU Redsteel!) colours are vibrant, animations smooth, models very detailed. Plus other effects like characters' armour falling off after taking damage (or in one case a head falling off) and magical effects make this game a nice visual treat (relatively speaking) both technically and aesthetically. Music is unremarkable, but it does give the game life, it does it's job, but you won't get any tunes stuck in your head or anything. Voice acting is surprisingly well done, and each voice just helps give each character their own quirky personality and makes it that much more fun to play (I especially like Bast's accent) sound effects are good too, with clangs and clashes and other various sounds happening, it'll definitely sound exciting when you're in the heat of battle.Overall, since it did a lot of experimentation and cleary didn't have enough time in development, you'll likely be yearning for more with an empty plate",https://metacritic.com/game/wii/tournament-of-legends

He has had enough of being bullied by the other bears, so he decides to go on a rampage. After this more things start to happen, like Army Bears attack you, Robots attack you, ninja's attack you and aliens attack you. You can tell it is an eventful game.Gameplay:Naughty bears gameplay is a dream come true, there is special moves like, sticking bears in fridges, brutally axing them and much more. There is a fairly big selection of weapons to use, from simple twigs to uzi's. You can also press L2/LT to roar, which will usually cause bears to run away in fear and if you scare them enough you can cause them to go insane and they will end up killing themselves. The only downsides I found with the gameplay is that you can't jump and it has afew lag problems, other than that its really impressive.Presentation:For 2010 Naughty Bear's graphic's are pretty basic. Although the graphics are nothing special, they don't look horrible, they actually go with the game. The cartoony style of this game fits in well. The bears and the environment are very colourful and nice to look at. The presentation of the menu was a big highlight for me because it looked way better than most other menu's, like the boring menu of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.Sounds:Although the bears only make squeaky noises, there is a commentator that is sort of the voice in Naughty's head that sounds great. He has an English accent and in my opinion deserves an award for his awesome voice acting. The guns and weapons make good sound when they hit a bear. There is one noise you will get used to, ROAR! You will get used to this because you will have to scare bears quite a lot in this game. The music in the game is like the music in a young children's TV show, but the music changes to a more serious tune when you start to cause loads of chaos.Multiplayer:Finding a game on Naughty Bear online can be hard sometimes, but when you do you will have a lot of fun. There are four game types, which are,Assault: In this mode There is two teams, one being red bears, one being blue bears. In this game mode, you will be trying to either destroy the other teams statue or protect your own one with your other team member. If a statue gets destroyed, the round ends and you will switch from Attack to Defence or Defence to attack.Cake Walk: In this mode, one player will have a cake and will have to hold it for as long as possible, while other players will try to kill that player for it.Golden Uzi: In this mode there is a powerful uzi(which is golden), that has infinite ammo and is very powerful. Players will have to try and retrieve the golden uzi, by either simply picking it up or just killing the player that has it in there possession and then picking it up.Jelly Wars: In this mode, you will either play as a normal bear or Naughty Bear. Three players will be normal bears and one player will be Naughty Bear. In this mode the normal bears objective is to find jelly and put it in a giant mixer, to make one giant jelly. The player that is playing as Naughty Bear will have to try and stop and kill these innocent bears who are just making jelly.Life-Span: Naughty Bear will last you a long time if you go back to levels and try and beat your score. You can also play the very addictive multiplayer, which will last you a while if you enjoy it as much as I do.Overall: This is a great game with some minor flaws that don't ruin it at all.Rating: 10/10",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/naughty-bear
