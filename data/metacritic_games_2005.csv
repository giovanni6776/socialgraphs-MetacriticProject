Infinity Ward has also expanded the scope of combat to deliver a truly realistic battlefield experience.  Squads now have the freedom to take on a variety of mission objectives, on expansive battlefields that allow for multiple paths and the ability to utilize actual combat tactics like outflanking and fire and maneuver capabilities. Call of Duty 2's new engine and A.I. technology set the stage for authentic squad combat and astonishing action.  Concealment can be key as battlefield smoke or even deployed smoke grenades cloud visibility.  Weather effects such as the dusty sandstorms of North Africa and whiteout blizzard conditions of Russia, for example, will keep soldiers glued to their bunkers.  The team has also employed a state-of-the-art Battle Chatter System that brings the action to life as squad-mates bark out context-sensitive updates in real-time to players through an advanced A.I. system.

Let yourself be carried away on the gentle airs of doping, corruption and hooliganism even before a match gets under way. Once on the pitch, if the ball doesn?t really interest you, then carry on destroying the opposition using all the underhand tricks at your disposal. If that doesn?t guarantee victory then magic and snares will come in useful. Even if massacring the opposition is encouraged, you?ll have to use far more subtle tactics to have a chance at winning.
