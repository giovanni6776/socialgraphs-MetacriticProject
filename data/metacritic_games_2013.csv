Presenting freedom of choice gameplay not seen since the original, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds makes no effort to hold the players hand through the richly dense world of Hyrule  and it works brilliantly. Rather than following in the footsteps of Game Freak and introducing the franchise to a new generation of audiences at the risk of patronising its long term fans, (I’m looking at you Pokémon X and Y) Link Between Worlds pays homage to those of us who have followed Link since his debut over 25 years ago  all whilst paving the way for a reinvention of what it means to make a Zelda game. The puzzles in Link Between Worlds are, as aforementioned, immensely satisfying. I could almost hear the pieces of a riddle snap together in my head as I strived to calculate the answer. It’s a feeling experienced whilst playing the Professor Layton series, but puzzle-solving in this game is made relevant and interesting by the vivid world, close to perfect combat and awe-inspiring imagination. This is a beautiful game, presenting a colourful and vibrant world that just seems to radiate adventure and exploration. The characters are complex and interesting, but perhaps the biggest achievement in terms of its presentation is the silky-smooth 60fps frame rate which stays consistent throughout this 18 hour adventure  even with the 3D effect turned on.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds

Просто стоить пробовать и самое главное не бросать сразу, если не понравится в первые несколько часов. Потому что именно так было у меня, когда я начал и поиграл пару дней, забросил даже на месяц где-то, а потом вновь вернулся и еще играл несколько раз и стало все интересней и интересней.

Конечно, после стольких часов игры + на пиратке еще наиграно было около 100 часов, она может надоесть. Однако есть индивиды, которые в ней 1000+ часов имеют. Сам лично вдохновлялся известными по этой игре стримерами на Twitch (Pibonacci, Kinijup, LateDog, dtea и krille71). Очень советую сперва смотреть стримы Pibonacci (возможно он уже не играет в нее щас, в чем я почти 100% уверен, однако парень поставил много рекордов в этой игре в спидранах). Не советую только смотреть сразу стримеров. Играйте сперва вслепую. Порекомендую в нее играть часов 30-40 хотя бы, вообще никуда не заглядывая (ни на youtube, твич, различные вики и т.п.). Спустя три года до сих пор ее считаю лучшим платформером за всё время существования. Ну и небольшая заметка для тех, кто наиграл или наиграет в нее сотню часов и более - загляните обязательно на оф. сайт рекордов по этой игре со ссылками на эти рекорды с видео - mosstierТОЧКАcom. Там когда-то был и я, а может и сейчас есть, единственный участник из стран СНГ, кто запостил туда свой никчемный рекорд на 50+ место)))). И да, когда вы увидите на этом сайте рекорды, когда какие-то сверхразумы проходят эту игру всякими способами просто с бешеной скоростью в кратчайшее время, у вас наверное мозг взорвется или челюсть отпадет в восторге и оху*нии от увиденного)) Удачи!",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/spelunky

For about ten years Paradox Development have been a small team of nice guys working hard to give us good games and mostly failing. Their games have been for the most part tedious, pretentious and ugly, with cluttered mechanisms, and hideous micromanagement. Most of the Paradox efforts suffered from terrible tutorials and ridiculous learning curved that discouraged any vaguely casual gamers. But beyond inaccessibility, the games were finally not that good, because even when you figured out the mechanisms they were still too MECHANICAL: not even really worth learning in the end because they were all variations of a sausage machine. However something miraculous happened with Crusaders Kings 2, and echoes of the good things we saw in earlier games (Hearts of Iron 2) reappeared: Better looking graphics. Simpler, yet DEEPER gameplay.  The machine kept churning away but Paradox learned to save us from the worst of it, and the gameplay began to blossom. Europa Universalis IV seems to demonstrate that Paradox has really turned the corner. The game is beautiful.  Gameplay is fluid. The depth and complication is welcome, but it has been softened with a more thoughtful and gaming friendly structure! GREAT WORK PARADOX! Good things take time, and your grand ambitions are finally bearing fruit. I'm very excited about where this will lead with the Hearts of Iron series, because all the design wisdom that we can see in CK2 and EU4 is leading in the absolute correct direction. If you love strategy gaming please go and buy this game and support this developer! This is a FAR, FAR superior game to Civilizations 1-5 as well as anything put out by Creative Assembly.

Apparently a point-and-click graphic adventure, this is actually much closer to an interactive graphic novel. It's really good literature, or art, or however you may categorize it. Obviously, though, the ""game"" dimension is only the method used to put the player in the middle of the story. The difficulty is trivial, and it consists merely in finding the way through the different locations on the map and sorting out the meaning of the quest, which is but an excuse for a compelling story about lonliness, frailty and oblivion. Now, about the script: it's more than excellent, it's really over the scale. Whoever has written the texts in this game has obviously read a lot and written a lot, and knows who Don Delillo or Faulkner are. Very often the choice of dialogues does not have any consequence on the development of the story --- it's just meant to let the player co-author the story, add and choose the details that frame the main characters. You won't like this game if you're looking for shiny entertainment and action, for real-time emotions where you can prove your gaming stamina. You will love this game if you enjoy art, design, reading a good story, and obviously if adventure games were your favorite genre. It's very hard to explain how fabulously original, simple, light and complex is the graphic aspect of this game. The map interface is a great idea and the medium by which minigames find their right place into the game, creating a spiraling sensation that destroys the common notion of space as the story approaches the zero. Slowly, also the environments lose features of reality and represent in a fascinating way the tricks of immagination, irrationality, oblivion and selflessness. Just play the game, you won't ever forget it.

The points in the levels give an extra incentive to play more, climb the leaderboards and challenge your friends. The addition of costumes and bonus hidden retro levels make it an even larger game.

I still don't know if this was due to shipping or the product itself... I was going to get it fixed at the music store a couple towns over, but never got around to it (I'm also a good example of procrastination). This time around I decided to do some more research before purchasing the guitar, but it seems the one that comes in the bundle is the best (or at least one of the best) for the price currently (Epiphone Les Paul Jr.).  I had to dig around for my old PS3 component cable, found it, left the video on HDMI and simply plugged the audio portion from the component cable directly into my stereo.  Tuning was a snap, and though during the very first lesson it felt awkward, I could tell I had made real progress by the very next day.  They say you can learn in 60 days, and right now I'm a believer.  I started before their online site was up (it's still in beta), but today it appears like a very good second screen tool to check your progress. Basically Rocksmith does for learning guitar what Mavis Beacon does for learning how to type.  It makes the learning process fun, changes it up so it doesn't get too monotonous, allows you freedom to learn what you want when you want to, provides immediate feedback and rewards. I'm not an expert yet, but the thing is I'm having enough fun for this to be a daily habit.  It's a console video game that teaches you a skill, and makes learning that skill fun enough to keep up with it over time.  I hope this coming generation sees Rocksmith continue to refine this process with their xB1 and PS4 offerings, while adding piano, drums, and vocals. Who knows, maybe even Khan Academy and Rosetta Stone could have their own console versions.  I remember ""educational"" games on the Magnavox Odyssey 2 back in the day.  They were not fun.  But the times and technologies have changed enough that I believe learning certain skills (especially musical ones) can be easy and entertaining at the same time. But back to Rocksmith 2014.  I can't find a fault in it, and maybe that's because I'm a beginner, but the thing is, it makes me want to keep that guitar in my hands every day and keep on learning new songs/techniques, so it is perfect for me.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/rocksmith-2014-edition

The only gripe for true purists will be the over-the-top WWEish MyCareer mode which includes cheesy cut-scenes & the innately annoying knack for your counterpart to always be catching fire & carrying his team to an unrealistic degree. Having said that, when you're dropping 20 & 10 in your rookie showcase game you can understand the developers pushing your competition. For those who enjoyed catching fire in the heyday of NBA Jam you'll LOVE 2k14's varying levels of getting ""ON FIRE!!"", including defensively if you make a few good plays on D (steals, blocks, etc). The visuals are stunning, presentation is as realistic as I've ever seen & they even use the Real Voice feature to have real coaches & players during interviews. The online is a different twist on park hoops which allows you to watch & join games going on live by calling ""next"". There's more modes than you'll even have time for which makes for an overwhelmingly awesome full package. NBA 2k14 is the Best Basketball Game Ever.

Each iteration is utterly fantastic and every bit as joyous as they are (at times) rage-inducingly infuriating, but for me at least, this wonderful scroller stands out on one system more than all others. And that is on Vita. That's partly down to the fact that Commander Video's sequel looks especially pretty on Vita's OLED screen (and the new slim models LCD too for that matter), but what really sets this version apart boils down to the Vita's inherent portability. With a game that's this downright addictive, the fact that you're not tethered to the living room TV is a huge bonus. It also helps that Runner 2 is just as well suited to quick bursts of pick-up-and-play micro fun as it is longer, extended sessions. Then there's the controls. I can't quite fathom out how, but when it comes to making Commander Video jump, slide, kick and block to absolute precision, the Vita's diminutive d-pad and face buttons somehow manage to feel even tighter than it's console counterparts. Finally, having a bunch of PSN trophies to acquire en route to Runner 2's delicious finalé dials up an already massively moreish title to 11 on the addict-a-scale! Like I've already alluded to, regardless of which platform you choose to sample Gaijin's unique brand of twitch-platforming thrills, Bit.Trip Presents...Runner 2 is an utterly fantastic indie-flavoured masterpiece, but if you're a multiple console owning gamer who also happens to have a Playstation Vita at your disposal, Sony's handheld is unquestionably the way to go on this occasion. Verdict: 9 out of 10An absolute must-have for all platform enthusiasts - especially those who own a Vita! .",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien

I have played almost all the entries in the Lego series since the DS and none of them created a game experience quite like this. My absolute favorite thing is just the massive scale of the open world. There's nothing quite like it, even in games like Skyrim or GTAV. The amount of collectables there are is insane and it doesn't feel tedious until you've done most of them. There are a huge amount of characters, vehicles and more. The developers even created things in the environment to interact with to make the game even better, like passing trains you can ride, NPC's spouting random dialogue to you and more. The level of enjoyment I got from playing this game was very high. The story missions gave us a more interesting storyline than previous entries which led me to find myself actually involved in the story. The vast amount of abilities you can use is comparable with other Lego games, but does not lack in the slightest. One thing that makes this game even better on Wii-U than any other platform is definitely the fact that one person can play on the TV while one is on the gamepad. This can make for some fun matches of hide-and-seek in the massive Manhattan setting that you just won't get on the PS4. Aside from this, the dialogue is hilarious both in story and free-roam. Also, the soundtrack that plays while you are in the open world is simple, catchy and enjoyable to listen to. Some cheat codes also unlock quirky modifications to appearance and gameplay that can be enjoyable. The only con I would have to give this game is the amount of bugs you'll find scattered in certain levels, but this doesn't render the game unplayable, as it often is just funny to watch. I have put countless hours into this game and still never explored everything or completed every collectable.

Each element is capable of forming a different number of bonds. You play as an atom of one of the elements, and if you move next to another element, the two elements will bond together if both have any remaining bonds. Once elements are bonded together, they start moving as one object. The difficulty comes from that if you form your molecule improperly, you may not be able to navigate around the level properly in order to form bonds with the atoms. Fortunately, each level has unlimited undos and can be reset easily, so a small mistake will not cause frustration. Upon completion, each level provides an interesting fact about the molecule you just formed. The level map plays an important role in progression in this game. Once a level is completed, the levels adjacent to the level you completed are unlocked. The game is divided into sections, and many of them introduce new mechanics. There is no order in which you must complete the levels; if you are stuck on one section, you can always attempt levels in a different section. There is an option to unlock all levels from the start, but I don't recommend using it unless you have been absolutely stumped on all of the available levels for hours. The game constantly mixes things up by providing new mechanics that add depth and complexity to the puzzles. Some levels have spaces that allow you to split bonds. Some levels have spaces that allow you to form double and triple bonds. Some levels have spaces that allow parts of your molecule to turn around corners. All of these mechanics are used in interesting ways. So far I have been talking on and on about how the game works and not about what I actually think of the game. So, what do I think of the game? I think this game is absolutely brilliant. The puzzles are quite difficult, but that makes them all the more satisfying when you solve them. There is also a huge variety in the puzzles; each puzzle is solved in a completely different way from the others. If I had to think of a complaint, it would be the lack of a level editor, but 144 puzzles is already quite a lot given the quality of the puzzles, and I don't think anybody could create puzzles as high quality as the ones created by the developers. All in all, a must-buy for any puzzle game fan.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/sokobond

These new experiences bring in very interesting situations with a lot of variations, and i love them all, even though i love Clementine, we always need something new. Now, as this is 5 new characters that we only have around 15-30 min with, we only get to know them in a very short amount of time, sometimes they tell about themselves to a person they just met, or you just have to listen to people talking with that person about maybe their sister or what crime they committed etc. For the most part, this works, but sometimes you can get a little lost. You also don't get the same attachments with these characters considering it's only 15-30 min with them, unlike Lee and Clementine, in which we had 10 hours to connect with them. But these 5 stories are intense, scary, brutal, and still emotional even though the short time. They all even have their own tone, which is really nice! The thing that i also like, is all the connections, because of these connections, i'd recommend you play through the stories by the time, Vince (2nd day) first, and last, Shel (236). You might remember a choice you made in Season 1 or in the previous story, and you might see a character from Season 1 or another story, and my reaction was either sad, happy, or just simply ""OH MY GOD!!!"". 400 Days is also full of plenty suprises along the way. The only negative about it is its short length. Sadly i can't give it a 9.5 here at Metacritic so i'll just give it a 10 :). www.youtube.com/headshotprolol -William",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/the-walking-dead-400-days

This bares little to no relation to Starfox. This is a ""reflex puzzle"" type obstacle-dodging game with the endless run kind of model. This may sound crude and simple, but Race the Sun totally comes out victorious in two respects: First I've only played a few fully enjoyable titles like this - most of the time you risk stumbling upon shovelware with this kind of game - and Race the Sun is an impeccable implementation of the genre on each and every aspect of its gameplay! It'll get your full undivided attention and give you many, many ""whew"" moments right off the bat. Secondly this game could've gone bad with its design style. You'll often see artists try the simplistic approach only get bland results instead of just simplicity. Race the Sun nailed their simplistic design, using modern graphics capabilities like post processing effects and lighting to clearly show a simplistic design really does not have to be bland for one bit! At the price they sell it it's a no brainer. It's a casual play so you can add it to your library even if you're currently going through other bigger titles. This is a nice side-game to have to fill in those voids where you need a break from the massive large-story type gaming.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/race-the-sun

He is an AI gone rogue, but an AI with a heart that is ultimately filled with friendship and heroism as he joins a band of other misfit AI to escape into the world. Thomas, as the name suggests, begins the story as a lone jumping rectangle that you guide through various simple side scrolling levels. On your journey however you meet various other quadrangles of different sizes that provide different skills; including a short wide pink one that functions as a trampoline, a large blue square that cant jump very high but floats on water and a tall slim yellow one that jumps to enormous heights. It is in this part of the design that the games concept truly excels, instead of learning skills you meet friends, instead of fighting enemies you tackle the changing levels as a team, you must use your brain and work out the correct way and place to make use of each characters skills to guide you through the story, a concept I really warmed to. Each shape is given unique personality and character via the stunningly charming and soothing narration by Danny Wallace continuing to add to the nonsensical depth of a group of shapes and giving you an idea of the importance of their adventure from their perspective. It is at this point where Thomas Was Alone really becomes an experience. The story narration, alongside beautiful music by Danny Housden, and lighting effects that are pointlessly beautiful, bring the mechanics of this little game to life. On face value this is a game where you play as a series of shapes jumping around a world, but the more you play, the more it becomes, making you care for the characters, cheer for them, vilify them and genuinely be happy for them as they progress through their journey, a journey that is all too short. And it is here where my only issue, but a personal argument lies. At around 3 hours this game is short as you'd expect from the price point and genre but I cant decide if I want more. There is a fascinating commentary edition to play through that as a fan of movie commentaries I loved but what I really wanted was more to play in this world. However the issue I'm facing is that I feel much more would have devalued it, risked the ‘novelty wearing off’ or myself becoming frustrated at an eventually rising difficulty curve. Thomas Was Alone is the beautiful vision of a single man that takes any ‘graphics over gameplay’ argument by the scruff of its neck and gives it a good smacking. You become engrossed in the story, the characters and the world in a way I haven't felt with any triple A games in a long long time and any indie games since Journey. Its low price point and short compact ‘experience it’ story make it a must buy with the latter being this games only downfall.

It's a fairly easy roguelike game considering that you can actually grind in order to get stronger unlike most. I also noticed that several people mentioned that the stat boosts you get when leveling in the dungeons doesn't affect much, which is definitely false.  Level 1 when you first start the game verses the end of the game is a HUGE difference.  By the end, my total level was 689 and even without my normal gear my main ATK and DEF stats were 315 and 216 respectively. The base stats were 135 and 130, so that's over a 2x increase for ATK and almost 2x for DEF.  It definitely makes things easier. Getting more into the game, the story, character development and gameplay are all superb.  This RPG actually had one of the most likeable protagonists I've ever encountered, and the development of both the main protagonist and Lilliel (his assistant) are fantastic.  The story slowly unfolds and is much deeper than originally shown, which ends up being on of the most memorable video game stories in a long time. The graphics are pretty awesome as well.  The sprite art is well detailed all around and transitions between combat and events pretty well.  The voice acting and SFX are pretty solid as well.  Nothing ground breaking, but it was all good. My main gripe with the game is that the middle chapters can feel pretty long.  Not very much goes on besides some sprinkles of story.  They probably could have cut out two or three chapters and it would have been more enjoyable in my opinion. Ratings are as follows: Story 4.5/5Graphics 5/5Gameplay 5/5Sound 4/5 So, overall I give it a 4.5/5.  Great gameplay and story, although a little drawn out, but definitely a great time.

Be careful though, not all the buildings are accessable and it's quite easy to be killed and wonder ""Where did that come from?"" Dig: Courtyard with a facelift, any World of War veterans will have a grand old time on this map due to its familliar routes and flanks, however it does look proportionally better and will offer a neat setting to newcomers to the series. Frost: This map is the one that interested me the most, frozen Amsterdam was always the one that I was excited for, however, there are a complete lack of sightlines for Snipers and CQB gets real tense, especially across the frozenr river. Takeoff: It's Stadium from Black Ops.... I don't even think I need to comment... Finally, Origins: This is probably the best Zombies map Treyarch have ever released, the characters from previous games are back and it is a much welcome sight, they do tell a lot more of the story and are extremely vocal. The new weapons are gorgeous and the easter egg is phenominal, the giant Mechs and the Tank add interesting aspects to this map and I think any veteran of Zombies is going to appreciate this sendoff for Black Ops 2 Overall, 8/10  but it gets a ten from me due to some ridiculous reviews.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii---apocalypse

The game play is focused on deck building as well as playing the combined card/board game, and the storyline is available in co-op. Before each map, you select a deck of cards that you can freely put together from your card collection. As you progress through the game you gain more and more cards to chose from, enabling you to put together more innovative combination. Each card played will influence the happening on the game board. You might put a new ironclad in play, give it better inventory or move it a lane down. Different maps have different objectives, and you will have to find the right deck to defeat each challenge. The story is cute and humorous, but personally I would have liked to see a darker take on robots in the American Civil War. The game offers the full campaign in co-op mode, which worked smoothly and unproblematic when I played it. There are cool, rewarding boss fights which will require you to think outside the box and the missions never get repetitive. The replay value is limited, since you'd be facing the same challenges, probably solving them with the same decks. There are some challenges (which unlock cards) that require you to do things for instance with certain types of decks though, but once that is done, there's no real need to play the map again. All in all a fun game, with an inspired rule set and a story and setting you don't see too often.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/ironclad-tactics

The game's premise as simple:  Playing as one of three characters in a futuristic sci-fi setting, you set out to explore ""The Pit"", scavenging for supplies, and defeating enemies as you go.  However, behind this simple premise lies a mixture of strategy and tactics the player must use to survive.  Each class has its pros and cons, and none of the three classes supplied makes this game a walk in the park.  The Pit can be frustrating at times  un-successful item crafting, not having the skills to use the itemse collected, and dying from wounds or poison.  But that's part of the fun.  If you are looking for a challenging game (even on Normal difficulty) that evokes memories of classic RPGs from days gone by, I highly recommend The Pit.  The only downside to this game is the chiptune music, which can be easily disabled in the Options menu.  If you are looking for a really fun single player RPG with crafting elements and permanent death, then check out The Pit.  Recommended.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-the-pit

I loved Dynasty Warriors 6 and 7, even though perhaps they had annoying flaws  but this game almost seems like KOEI listened to the fans, and gave them what they really wanted this time around!!  The presentation is good, granted there is a little slowdown at times, but for most of the time there are hundreds of antagonists on screen and it runs just beautifully.  The backdrops have a little bit of variety to them, but its the characters that steal the show, for they are beautiful.  The music, voiceovers and FX are exactly what you'd expect for Dynasty Warriors, but this isn't a complaint, for if it were different, this would not be Dynasty Warriors  live with it, enjoy it, and be done.  Gameplay-wize the game is just sublime!!  The Story mode is hugely branching, also chucking in some severely smart (and huge!!) battles, the Free mode is a welcome addition marking a return, and Ambition mode is more than a tacked-on extra  it must really kill KOEI that they have made every single 'Empires' version of Dynasty Warriors almost obsolete!!  Well, it seems like that to me!!  Combat is the usual, but its hefty, and thanks to some honestly genius forethought, you have more power over how your character performs in the heat of battle, when they meet certain criteria (yes, it does make a huge difference!!).  That, and simple things, like calling your horse and jumping on it with a single button, may seem simple but they add much to the whole feeling of the combat in this game  huge, slick, fast, and of a coordinated chaotic ballet, and in many way the repetition of the combat is somewhat tempered, though I can understand the repetition may come through on occasion.  I would normally give this a 9, saying that its really a specialist kind of a game, and that for the cost it is, you'd really have to commit to this (or play a demo).  But be damned, in this time ironically, this is a fresh vital thing, not just to the series, but of software in general to play at the moment.  I personally give this a 10, as I think its that good  its now up to you, if you haven't played this series in a long time, to decide whether its worth the outlay, but I still urge you to try it.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/dynasty-warriors-8

It resets the stage every minute just about the time it starts getting interesting. It starts way too slow and you have to go through 4 one minutes stages to get to the fun ones. The mission structure is weird and you often don't feel need to finish your game after you get the mission done. It would better if you had a set amount of people to get through the bathroom instead of just surviving the time limit because you can just kind of park people at the end of the minute and cheese your way through. The gameplay is great and the controls work well. This game teases the fun more that it lets you just have the fun.

I took a bite with expectation that it would satisfy me. The cream is fine, but I was disappointed because the bread inside was too fluffy and tasteless. This game is just like that. Unlike the expectation of the design art, it was boring and disappointing side-scroll action game. The design art, concept and story of this game is definitely attractive. However, it is a game that can't satisfy the basic expectation of universal side-scroll game. Unlike a game that has only moving and shoot (like Metal slug, Rock man), although this game enter the command actions, the moving according to the keyboard control is not smooth. It make me feel less thrilling and frustrating. Additionally, poor hitting effects and (although there are many skills and actions...) using only certain efficient skill make it boring. 보기 좋게 생긴 생크림 케잌이 눈에 들어왔다. 바라던 달달함을 충족시킬 수 있을꺼라 기대하고 한 입 베어물었더니, 크림은 괜찮은데 안에 있는 빵이 너무 퍼석퍼석하고 맛이 없어서 어이가 없었다. 이 게임이 딱 그런 느낌이었다. 디자인을 보고 가진 기대감과는 다르게 지루하고 아쉬운 횡스크롤 액션 게임이었다. 디자인과 캐릭터 컨셉, 스토리는 분명히 매력적이다. 하지만 횡스크롤 액션에 대한 기본적인 기대감을 전혀 충족시켜주지 못하는 게임이다. (록맨이나 메탈슬러그와 같이) 무빙과 Shoot 공격만 있는 횡스크롤 게임이 아니라 커맨드를 입력하는 게임임에도 컨트롤에 따른 무빙이 매끄럽지 못해 박진감이 떨어지고 답답하다. 그리고 부족한 타격감과 (다양한 기술들이 있음에도) 효율적인 특정 기술만 사용하게 되다보니 결국 플레이 내내 지루한 액션 게임이 되버렸다.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/dusty-revenge

Theres my favorite elimination..I havnt had this much fun in a kart racer in a while..Before each race you chose your character you think will be best for the challenge youre about to take on and you go at it…drifting and tracks for speed boosts, speed pads all over the place, constant offensive and defensive pick ups…every race is so thrilling and you actually feel like skill matters here…With this resurgence of arcade racers from indie teams lately.. its nice to go back and feel that balance where pickups shortcuts and timing actually matters… especially with the different stats and versions of characters… it doesn’t feel luck based that everyone is on an even playing field .. it feels like every player on the track is in their own world.. in their own race where their objective and your objective and strategy aren’t the same…this is really highlighted in modes like elimination where not only are you racing for 1st place, but you only have 3 lives… you have to choose if youre going to risk taking a shortcut where its easy to fly off of the track, or are you going to hang in the back to deal damage, or maintain the lead trying to dodge it with a giant target on your back..this was the most interesting mode to me and I wish the campaign had more of it..and you heard me right earlier.. every character has different versions of themselves..as you use a character you gain xp to level them up.. this will unlock new modded versions of them wit different stats…so if you don’t like the base stats of your favorite character you can grind to level them up and choose a different version of them that is more your play style..the difficulty you take on these challenges though actually do matter.. you cant just easy mode your way through the career mode..you have to go for higher stars in modes you feel more confident in so that you can unlock alternate paths with more tracks as well as unlock characters and a bonus moderation…this adds to the addictiveness of going back and mastering tracks or modes, increasing your star count..And these tracks are all fun to race through.. especially with the whople transformed thing going on..you don’t get to choose when to transform but as you race there will be sections where youll be plying through the air, or racing through the sea just to land back on land again.. and all 3 of these flow perfectly, none of them annoying.. I hate flying in games.. I hate controlling planes.. but it feels responsive and smooth here, you hardly notice that anything has changes…My favorite thing this game does that I wish it did more of is actually tranfroming the map as your race it..there are some really cool maps that the final lap is completely different than the first 2 as things start to fall and crumble..I wish the played with this idea more, making every lap in every tracks different..Sonic * All Stars racing again is probably the best Kart racer not on a Nintendo console and is a must play for fans of this genreI give Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed an 8/10",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed

Two players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras. The empty beach, the strong wind, the gentle music and a small colony of electric seagulls are their only companions. Yet their heart is full and their mind confused. Walk along the shore, until they meet the emptiness. When it all becomes too much, they run towards each other. Enabled by intergalactic networks, they touch each other’s holographic bodies in cyberspace. A surreal game of chess becomes the apparatus through which they, man and woman, can talk. The words they have were given to them, as they have always been to lovers everywhere. The sea remains, tugging at their hearts when not at their hairs and clothes, as it itself is tugged by the virtual moon. And as great as the desire for the other may be, they cannot stay away from the wind and the waves and the sand. Every time they find a new treasure. An abandoned tennis field. An heap of coal. A dead dog. Ordinary. Absurd. Meaningless. Yet comforting. Enter a café, exit a villa, enter a casino, exit the ruin of an ancient colonial mansion. We know this is not real. So it doesn’t surprise us. Nothing surprises us. It doesn’t matter when you feel the pain of love. Of being in love, of falling in love, of leaving in love. There is no such thing as time.

However he soon realises once again that nothing goes quite as smoothly as Jack had imagined. Shanghai, 1899 -The mysterious Chinese city is the epicentre for adventurers of all kinds. Jack Keane, too, has been attracted to the place by rumours of a legendary treasure - or to be more precise, these tales have led him right inside the walls of the notorious Shanghai prison. It is within these walls that the guardian of the treasure, a secretive shaman, has been locked up for years. Unfortunately for our hero, Jack has completely disregarded the fact that it is a lot easier to get INTO prison than out of it And this is only the beginning of Jack Keane's newest bizarre adventure: mysterious treasures, ruthless villains, two distractingly beautiful women and tons of clever humour await the most lovable treasure hunter to have ever sailed the seven seas in a comical tour de force around the globe. During his travels, Jack will not only meet old friends, but also encounter new faces such as the elegant city-lady Eve and the brilliant German engineer Carl. Jack Keane 2 - The Fire Within is set to revolutionise the classic point & click adventure genre. Never has an adventure been as cinematic, fast-paced and humorous, without breaking any of the iconic point & click gameplay rules. State of the art 3D-graphics, gripping action-sequences and the typical bizarre Jack Keanesque humour will be an absolute delight to all adventure fans. Features - Control your characters directly with WASD, or switch to the classic Point & Click-Style- Experience the kind of love triangle we all know from everyday life movies- Explore your own mind (literally), chase zeppelins by car, and learn a wide array of fight-stances to counter your opponents frantic moves- Created by the developers of adventure hits such as Ankh, Jack Keane and Black Sails- State of the art 3D-graphics based on Deck 13s revolutionary FLEDGE engine- The mix of fast-paced action sequences and iconic point & click-gameplay makes Jack Keane 2 - The Fire Within a truly 21st Century adventure",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/jack-keane-2-the-fire-within

Me, that's who!In reality it's clear the game is mainly marketed at children who are watching the animated series; if reviewers think the game is too hard for children they are underestimating them. When I go back to some of the Spectrum and Master System games I used to play, in a time when arcade 'pay more money or gameover' ruled the gaming world, I realise just how hard some of the games I used to play as a child were. Adventure platformers are a rare thing now. Heck, in the N64's generation they were pretty much the mainstream genre (Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie & Tooie, DK64, Mystical Ninja et al). The huge worlds are probably deemed too time consuming to develop nowadays.Pacman and the Ghostly Adventures stands as a polished, colourful example in a time starved of such games. It doesn't really offer anything new, but it does offer challenge and variety and plenty of fun. The graphics are sharp and colourful, the music ranges from chirpy, catchy tunes to epic orchestral pieces and there is plenty of content. The bonus levels offer the greater challenge and I found them to be the most fun.Also, I had no problems with the camera. If you choose to use the right stick to take control the auto camera may take a back seat for a brief while, but I tend to use manual controls to constantly tweak the camera in these sorts of games any way. Thankfully it was easy to in this one. If you like adventure platformers, I highly recommend giving this a try, especially given the low asking price.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/pac-man-and-the-ghostly-adventures

I'm glad I got that message for a change, because with keyboard and mouse it was next to impossible to play. The game is great fun and highly addictive, but from what I can see, not very popular on steam. I don't know why this is as its a fantastic game. You have a story mode, and a traditional arcade mode (with leaderboards everyone. Yes. You can own your friends). The story mode follows a very basic story and has several objectified missions to get to a dimensional portal at the end of the zone. There is plenty to do. And you get rewarded for exploring all the map with bonus unlocks and bonus health items. Your ship is also fully customisable with whatever powers you desire from the menu, different combinations will give you different pro's and cons of course, but work out whats good for you. The soundtrack to this game in my opinion is rather good, but gets slightly repetitive when you've been in the same zone for a while. All in all, Hexodius is a great and addictive twin stick shooter, and there is a lot on offer if you try to give it the time of day.

It features every beloved main character, and voice acting from each one as well (which I was pleasantly surprised with!).  The environment art style is smooth and aesthetic, just like the show, while the title screen, characters, and items are designed with pixel art which fits in nicely for a fun visual design overall.  The music in the tile is a catchy chiptune, and the in-game music grooves non-stop and lives up to the awesomeness of the show.The game's concept is simple.  Explore deeper and deeper through many levels and areas of Princess Bubblegum's dungeon to find out what the heck is happening with her prisoners.  Each level contains interesting foes who you can fight for gold and items.  There are quite a few crazy and quirky items which you won't know exactly what they do until you find them and try them out yourself, which gives it a subtle Binding of Isaac vibe.  In addition to all this, you have BMO talking to you constantly through the WiiU gamepad about what's happening as you play which is super awesome and fun.Essentially, everything about Adventure Time: EtDBIDK is amazing besides the actual gameplay itself.  Which will leave the gamer and fan of AT feeling let down.  The game can't seem to find a fun balance between way too easy, and way too harsh and unfair.  You collect gold in the dungeon to spend at ground level for upgrades or items for whichever character you control at the time, but if you die, that gold is cut in half and you are sent to ground level, and forced to spend it, because if you go back in the dungeon, Princess Bubblegum takes all of it for ""tax reasons"".  There are pretty neat boss fights that (after the first one) you will probably die a few times in, which takes the player by surprise after waltzing through the non-boss levels with hardly even a scratch.  Thankfully, the game allows 3 deaths before cutting your gold in half, but it still is frustrating because there's no way to go back up to the surface besides ONE CHECKPOINT per area, which is halfway between the last boss and the next, so collecting gold can feel futile and frustrating if saving up for an upgrade.As a big fan of Adventure Time, I was looking forward to this game because of all the awesome potential it had, and it succeeded in some areas, but considering the poorly designed gameplay, I would really only recommend this game for much younger fans of the show, who perhaps won't be bored by the easy parts and will feel more rewarded for overcoming the difficulties/unfairness.",https://metacritic.com/game/wii-u/adventure-time-explore-the-dungeon-because-i-dont-know!

There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and cinematic experiences. The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years. This project, working title TAKEDOWN, aims to change that. This game, the spiritual successor to games like the original Rainbow Six and SWAT series, will focus on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your plans, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You wont be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don't expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you - it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand. AKEDOWN is a thinking-persons shooter. The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability. The operation to clear pirates from a hijacked oil tanker by Russian special forces in May of 2010 is a perfect example of the types of missions in TAKEDOWN. You will plan your insertions and routes before going into the scenario, outfitting your teammates with weapons and equipment of your choosing, and then execute the mission. If one of your team members is killed, they are gone, and you have lost their valuable experience, so you have to be careful!  Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer. If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the project for you.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/takedown-red-sabre

The biker movement, rock music and the hippie counterculture all add to the fascinating atmosphere to be experienced in Ride to Hell. Action-loaded from the very start with free roaming environments, players can immerse themselves in the liberty and freedom of riding full throttle with their gang on a multitude of different vehicles through the dusty flats of Western America. Protecting their turf, their brothers and their machines from rival gangs is just a taste of what this epic game involves. Ride to Hell is not for the faint-hearted; it's aimed heavily at the player who wants to become fully involved in the original West Coast biker culture. With its hard drinking, bare-knuckle environment, this is as close to the action as you can get. [Deep Silver]",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/ride-to-hell-retribution

I love to play coop with my kid, and he LOVE to play even more with me. I still don't understand why this huge wave of rate against this game, is NOT the same Double Dragon II : The Revenge, it's ""Wander of the Dragons"" which is another game, another history... deal with it! All missions are great and very diverse, playing coop is the best like the old ones, and even have a survival mode which is very cool! :D I saw people complaining about be a easy game, that you can beat in few hours, bla bla bla... so why are you playing this on easy mode? Are you retarded? And that's great to have a easy mode, so I can play with my kid since he had 3 years old. We played this games several times the missions and also the survival mode in the last year. And it's still fun. Double Dragon II : The Revenge it's my all time favorite game, but this one have everything the original had, and lots more... aside all that I wrote above also improved and 3D graphics. I love this series and have ALL OF THEM READY TO PLAY in the PC that I made to my kid, with emulators from all consoles available... And believe me, when we think to play Double Dragon, this one is the best experience available and my kid's favorite. We have Double Dragon NEON on PC and PS3, but we still prefer to play Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons on XBOX 360, and is the main cause I didn't sell the console yet. I wish this game be released on PC (Steam?) one day... It's really a great Double Dragon tittle!",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/double-dragon-ii-wander-of-the-dragons
