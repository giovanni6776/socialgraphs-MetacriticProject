The time travel mission goes awry, creating an alternate timeline where technology has followed an entirely different evolution, a new superpower has been thrust on to the world stage, and World War III is raging.

As our economies and our way of life tumble into chaos, the superpowers clash to gain control. Set in a fictional future based upon the headlines of today, F.O.W. brings players into the world's next great war. As society succumbs to a worldwide energy crisis, a new global depression takes hold. Amidst this desperate backdrop, two superpower alliances emerge. Join the battle on the frontlines of tomorrow as the Western Coalition (U.S./E.U.) or the Red Star Alliance (Russia/China). Tomorrow's weapons, today: As depicted in F.O.W., the U.S./E.U. and Russia/China have combined their military research and budgets, and the result is over 60 next-gen vehicles and weapons inspired by military designs for the near future. This includes remote controlled drones, gun cams, and next-generation counter-measures systems, all of which are player-controllable. Use high-tech combat systems to collect and relay recon, targeting, and threat information between team mates. Target acquisition and sharing between vehicle occupants is just one example of F.O.W.'s focus on an advanced team play experience. The customization system allows players to grow their soldier to fit their play style by choosing a weapons loadout, as well as a technical specialization (role). As the game progresses each role will upgrade, providing advanced equipment and abilities. The system is a mix of RPG-like depth but with the accessibility of a fast-paced FPS. Frontline combat system: The main game mechanic featured in F.O.W. in both in single player and multiplayer, is the ability to join the forces on the front line. This front expands across large portions of a mission and will require a strategy to achieve the contextual objectives in order to move this front forward. Not only does this system keep the battle centric and players in the midst of the action, it gives a unique sense of advancement as your Division is rewarded with territory for their victories. Choose your path to victory: Within the front, players can take advantage of a sandbox of destructible elements and various weapons of war to create their own unique paths and strategies. Instead of failing and re-playing the same sequence of events, players can 'chip-away' with varied approaches, allowing diverse missions with high replay value.

As our economies and our way of life tumble into chaos, the superpowers clash to gain control. Set in a fictional future based upon the headlines of today, F.O.W. brings players into the world's next great war. As society succumbs to a worldwide energy crisis, a new global depression takes hold. Amidst this desperate backdrop, two superpower alliances emerge. Join the battle on the frontlines of tomorrow as the Western Coalition (U.S./E.U.) or the Red Star Alliance (Russia/China). Tomorrow's weapons, today: As depicted in F.O.W., the U.S./E.U. and Russia/China have combined their military research and budgets, and the result is over 60 next-gen vehicles and weapons inspired by military designs for the near future. This includes remote controlled drones, gun cams, and next-generation counter-measures systems, all of which are player-controllable. Use high-tech combat systems to collect and relay recon, targeting, and threat information between team mates. Target acquisition and sharing between vehicle occupants is just one example of F.O.W.'s focus on an advanced team play experience. The customization system allows players to grow their soldier to fit their play style by choosing a weapons loadout, as well as a technical specialization (role). As the game progresses each role will upgrade, providing advanced equipment and abilities. The system is a mix of RPG-like depth but with the accessibility of a fast-paced FPS. Frontline combat system: The main game mechanic featured in F.O.W. in both in single player and multiplayer, is the ability to join the forces on the front line. This front expands across large portions of a mission and will require a strategy to achieve the contextual objectives in order to move this front forward. Not only does this system keep the battle centric and players in the midst of the action, it gives a unique sense of advancement as your Division is rewarded with territory for their victories. Choose your path to victory: Within the front, players can take advantage of a sandbox of destructible elements and various weapons of war to create their own unique paths and strategies. Instead of failing and re-playing the same sequence of events, players can 'chip-away' with varied approaches, allowing diverse missions with high replay value.

Sure the game is repetitive, but I find myself getting familiar with the characters easily. It's just that I'd rather play this instead of Animal Crossing, because of their copy-pasted character behaviors. It's honestly one of the main drawbacks of Animal crossing, but hey, this is a MySims review, so why don't I start actually listing off what I like so much about it? So, firstly, I like the sense of progression. Knowing that there's a specific goal for you, the player, to reach is much better, because the journey to the main event was so good. I find that people actually are deterred from MySims in the early game, because of their lack of engagement. It's just that what the media said about MySims boasted an experience better than what's already in store, but in actuality it really Isn't. Since of all of this extra mumbo jumbo and the introductory stages of the game being a snore fest, people quit the game early on because of the bland beginning. The game truly gets better past star level 2. MySims is basically a Homework simulator, and I definitely agree with that. I guess when I get some sort of cycle of work (that is actually beneficial to my well-being), MySims will just become some sort of lost nostalgia, where I willingly spent the majority of my free time running around for 2 hours straight waiting to get virtual items out of an RNG based system. Which brings me to my last mini-paragraph, what should be included if there was a sequel. First thing s first, some sort of alternate way to get essences in bulk. This will obviously ruin some of the core gameplay aspects, but bare with me here, I'm thinking of making some sort of shop, currency, something generic like that. But then again, ruining the grinding aspect of the game really throws the game off, but what if we actually expanded the Townie's character (like give them more of a reason to exist). Make them give out essences of their interests for talking to them, building their actual character, because they are just stereotypes (most of them, really) and are a bit bland, but still better than Animal Crossing's poor excuse of life. Mabie adding another type of task would make things more interesting, and actually, having more of a say in town planning would be cool, like they're still would be the different zones, but have like, more zones branch off of them. First, remove how the Garden and the Main Town are divided by train, and add the garden as a reward for the new star level 5. then, the forest can have a more swampy area after it, fitted for more spooky sims. have that for star level 6. Then, for Star level 9, The beach, which branches off of the Desert, will be it's independent area. we can replace that old area with more of a ruins-esque area. Star level 8 will unlock an entirely new area filled with snow, something similar to MySims Racing's snowy suburbs. Star Level 9 is important, as it's the last star level before the end of the game. First, the area should be the Peaks, branching off of that  new snowy area. there should be an abandoned observatory there, giving Prof. Nova a new role. As a Challenge, you can match constellations (and make some of your own to light the night sky) in turn of essences. For star level 10, Instead of just giving you a stature and a pat on the back, you will get access to the deep garden, past those ruins of the actual Garden. This will host more space for houses and level 10 excusive essences. Oh yeah, every star level will get their fair share of new characters and essences. also, there should be at least two new interests introduced past star level 5, i was thinking of two total opposites like Snooty (since studious doesn't really define that) and something like Kiddie, (like cute, but more centered around juvenile qualities). So yeah, that's my overwritten review of MySimc PC.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/mysims

You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world of Mercenaries is as honorable.

As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics. The differing states of superhumanity result in balanced yet stylistically different combat tactics that have never been seen before. [LucasArts]",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/fracture

As a result of the polar ice cap melting, the Mississippi River has destroyed the central portion of the United States, causing an ill-equipped Federal Government to fail and literally cutting the country in half. These two halves are left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The East, now known as the Atlantic Alliance, symbolic of their union with Europe, puts its faith in surviving this new world in cybernetics, an established yet evolving technology now more than 150 years old. On the other side of the flooded continent, the Western states, now called the Republic of Pacifica and having allied with Asia, resort to solving their problems at the genetic level, effectively restructuring the DNA of its inhabitants -- a method the Atlantic Alliance finds morally reprehensible. By 2161, it only takes a hint of unauthorized military preparation in Pacifica for the newly restored president to order a strike in the heart of Pacifican territory -- an outpost in the now dry San Francisco Bay. This strike leads to the unthinkable: an epic conflict with global implications fought on U.S. soil. As a soldier in this struggle, Mason Briggs uses explosive, terrain-deforming weaponry to change the face of battle: He not only destroys the land in his path, he outright transforms it to gain the strategic advantage in completely unscripted ways no game has ever seen. With such a devastating arsenal at hand, Briggs never leaves any battlefield the way he found it. In addition to weaponry that allows players to do things previously only imagined, each side of the conflict, Pacifica and the Atlantic Alliance, boast soldiers with powers beyond those of ordinary men. Genetic augmentations provide Pacifican forces with amazing abilities, while Atlantic Alliance soldiers like Briggs counter the threat with the more ""traditional"" method: cybernetics.

Though kingdom isn't a normal sims game, I still had an amazing time with it and invested thousands of hours into it. I loved every single second of it, every mini game, new shop, the storyline, I look back on the memories of this game so very fondly. However, this was when I was 10, and looking back on it now I definitely was looking past a lot of the flaws the game had. The main problem I have with it is likely the storyline, and I know that for games like these the story shouldn't matter much but other games like animal crossing almost completely disregard the story in favor of more light hearted and passive activities you can partake in. Now, I am going to reference animal crossing a lot here as my sims kingdom seems to take a lot of inspiration from it. The thing that makes animal crossing so great is that it gives the player full control and freedom over what they can do, they don't tell them to do something or anything like that, with kingdom however there tends to be times where there simply isn't anything to do at all. Be mindful that I haven't played this game in years but I do remember being very bored at times or very frustrated at the controls or the game not explaining something properly.

The majority of gameplay seems to be playing with the animals or caring for them in some way to gain their affection. After doing so you unlock some mini games as well as the ability to capture their photos to save to an album. As a grown adult... Not really my cup of tea. If I were a child I could probably garner some enjoyment out of this, since it does remind me of the Nintendogs series minus some gameplay features. Some frustrating parts of the gameplay is a clear lack of a goal to reach while taking care of the animals. For example, you can pet or give them a bath but it's not made clear if you can just keep doing this, or if you have to do it for a certain amount of time. With washing, it seemed like there was little indication as to whether I was doing it right. petting they gave a little frustrated signal if I pet them wrong. It isn't clear if it's because I'm petting the incorrect spot, or if I'm doing it too tough, or anything. I don't know. There just seems to be very little to gauge the little playtime you do spend, which doesn't really allow me to optimize while playing... but perhaps the point is just to relax and enjoy the game. That being said, although the graphics are pretty good for the DS especially with how early it released, the gameplay is a bit too simple and boring to enjoy.
