By pressing the touchpad of the PS4 joystick, you pause the game and enter this mode, and by moving your fingers on the touchpad, you zoom in and out on the image and drag the image frame; and finally, by pressing the Share button, you can take a photo and share it with everyone. This Camera Mode is a great way to observe in detail all the characters and settings of the game, and a great way of expression to create wacky images with the elements found in the game. On PS4, you can also use the touchpad to scrape the famous Lucky Tickets, then you will really feel like you’re scraping lottery tickets (with the sound of scraping straight from the PS4 joystick). Finally, in this PS4 version, you’ll also find new playable heroes: Assassin Ray (a character inspired by Edward Kenway, the hero of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag), Funky Ray (a delusional character that you can unlock by using Uplay points), and Champion Ray (a character who will be offered to the best players of the community and those who live in this community; this character correspond to the new VIP status, visible in the rankings of online challenges).

Unlike most shallow sci-fi stories, Steins Gate is hard science-fiction, which goes into detail on how the science works. However, a lot of hard sci-fi usually suffer from being convoluted or lacking characterization. Steins Gate strikes a great balance, dealing with many current scientific theories in an understandable and digestible way without becoming convoluted, yet this never gets in the way of the amazing characterization. The plot twists are also very well-done. Unlike a lot of sci-fi plot twists, the plot twists in Steins Gate don't come from nowhere, but are always foreshadowed and well-explained within the context of the narrative. And because of the strong characterization, making you care for the characters, the story always packs a powerful emotional punch. Characterization - This is where Steins Gate truly shines. The cast of characters are very well-written and memorable. The star of the show is Okabe, a self-proclaimed ""mad scientist"" and one of the most likeable protagonists I've ever come across. At first he comes across as being arrogant and delusional, but as we listen to this thoughts, he comes across as a well-developed, three-dimensional person, with human flaws and anxieties beyond his arrogant and quirky exterior. The lead female character Kurisu is also very well-written.  She's a mentally strong character, with an intellect rivalling Okabe, and has a well-developed, three-dimensional personality. This makes the relationship and banter between Okabe and Makise immensely enjoyable. The supporting cast are also well-developed and likeable in their own ways, including the naive childhood friend Mayuri, the Otaku nerd Daru, the fake ""moe"" character Faris, the landlord Mr. Braun, the part-time ""warrior"" Suzuha, etc. Steins Gate makes you care for the characters, adding a great deal of emotional weight to the story. Gameplay - This is where some of the more traditional gamers might have an issue, but something most visual novel fans should be used to. Like most visual novels, you'll be spending a lot of time reading, with the gameplay mostly limited to making decisions that impact the narrative flow. And like most visual novels, the decisions you make have a big impact on how the story unfolds. Unlike most RPG's where the choices usually have very little impact on how the story unfolds, the choices in visual novels like Steins Gate can have major unforeseen consequences and lead you down different narrative paths. Compared to our average visual novel, however, Steins Gate adds more interactivity with Okabe's cell phone, which becomes is a kind of time-texting device in the story. This is where you make your choices, with the way you use your cell phone affecting how the story unfolds, whether it's deciding whether to answer calls or read text messages, or how you choose to respond to calls and messages. This innovative gameplay mechanic helps give the game more interactivity than what you'd find in your average visual novel. Visuals - The visuals in Steins Gate are unique and original. The dark tones, the water-colour art, and the grimy look, all give the game a dark, unique feel. It's also refreshing that, unlike most anime and visual novels, there isn't much pretty-boy ""androgyny"" to the male characters (except for Luka, in a subversive way), nor is there much ""male gaze"" sexualization to the female characters (except for Faris, but still toned-down). The most unique aspect of the character design is the eyes, which have a swirly hypnotic look to them, adding to the game's dark mood. Overall, the art-work is very impressive. Audio - This is something that visual novels (also called ""sound novels"") usually excel at, and Steins Gate is better than most. While the voices are only in Japanese, the voice acting is excellent. The voice actors did a great job at portraying the characters, perfectly capturing the personalities, tones, expressions, and emotions. The sound effects are also put to great use, with the right sound effects at the right moments. And the music does a great job of capturing the right mood at the right times. Pros - The writing, storytelling, and characterization, are some of the best I've seen in any medium, let alone video games.  The visuals and audio are excellent. The gameplay, revolving around a time-texting cell phone, is also unique. Cons - The gameplay is somewhat limited compared to your average video game. There's a lot of reading, for those not used to reading. Overall - Steins Gate is a masterpiece.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/steinsgate

Despite classic arcade-like design principles, it's not a ""nostalgia game""; it can hardly be described as ""X meets Y"". Maybe Sin & Punishment's cinematic on-rails presentation + a shmup's bullet dodging + Alien Soldier's sheer variety of stuff to do... but that wouldn't really do it justice. It's not really a bullet-hell; I'd have trouble calling it a shmup. It's more of an... anime mecha game. You control a robot while locking-on, shooting, sword-slashing and comboing your way through various perspective-shifting stages. You have two normal shots (activated by tapping their respective buttons) & two lock-ons (holding down their respective button). The lock-ons are a forward & spread shot respectively, either targeting around you in a circle or in a straight line. Your slash is more than it seems at first glance; sure, you can quickly tap the attack button to do a fast combo, but this can often leave you open; sometimes, AVOIDING the longer combo attack by timing your presses just right is the better way to go. You can also hold on to the sword button along with whatever direction you want to dash towards, sword-first. Lastly you have a variety of context-sensitive special attacks; if you press the special attack button while locked on to nothing, you will damage whatever is near you (the range of this effect increases once you unlock the second mech) and creates a short aura of invincibility around you, which adds a nice element of strategy. While locked on to a large group of enemies, your mecha will automatically home in on them and slash them up at a crazy speed; meanwhile, while only locked on to a single enemy, you will pull off a very anime-esque move on it taking out a significant chunk of its health. The scoring system is easy to understand and hard to master and involves plenty of practice of all the aforementioned skills (once again, refer to the tutorial on scoring). Many will feel that the game will completely destroy your fingers, but if you find yourself mindlessly mashing the normal shots chances are you're not playing it right; the lock-on is very useful throughout most of the game and balances out the button-mashing quite well. The on-rails camera-shifting (from side-scrolling to vertical shooter to behind-the-back third-person) is truly impressive; it helps add to the game's variety while also making for interestingly-composed cinematography. My only two significant gameplay gripes are the balance issues and the lack of a DEFAULT option to set the movement keys to WASD. The latter, however, is easily fixed by googling ""Astebreed WASD"" and getting the Astebreed tweaker from the Steam forums (however note that sometimes it might create a strange delay for the directional keys; if this happens, just restore the defaults and set your own controls again). The former might just be a result if my (crappy) play style, but it feels like an area in stage 3 along with the last boss are both a bit too much of a difficulty spike. Even then it's nothing as big as, say, the contrast in difficulty between Ikaruga's first and second stages. Beyond that we have the occasional bizarre crash when using the ""restart game"" feature, but this can't actually destroy one of your runs, so I can look past it (also my computer is an ancient piece of garbage that was old even when I got it in 2008 and I can't even properly play this on max settings) This is also a short game, but if you're into arcade games this should not be an issue; arcade design is not about artificially creating ""pacing"" by stopping the action to force you to solve physics ""puzzles"" or pushing a block over a switch, which can be an issue with otherwise-great games. There is no exploration and no grinding; the game's world is not your oyster. Good arcade design is about pure non-stop gameplay bliss, a barrage of creative enemy formations and set-pieces that will stay with you for years. It is not about offering the player the illusion that they are forging their own path, but about creating a pre-set obstacle course and then giving you a very wide variety of ways of making your way through it and grading them based on their inventiveness. Replayability comes in the form of beating all the modes with all the mechs, 1CCing hard more and improving your global score.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/astebreed

With each team having their own strenghts and weakenesses you can really empower them in season mode with coaches. The coaches are well thought out, you get new ones as you level through the season (these levels carry on to new seasons too!) which give you modifiers on your players. These modifiers change depending on what team you choose and you can't select all the coaches at one time as you are limited by your level (and new one keep appearing as you level up.)

I originally played this masterpiece on my PC, a powerful rig with crossfired 7970's and a 2600K at 4.8Ghz. I thought that the game was visually exquisite on my configuration with TressFX etc all enabled and a stable performer, although even my rig couldn't escape frame dips from a v-synced 60fps in areas such as shanty town. I think the devs have done a commendable job porting this to the much weaker, but still very capable, PS4 with so many visual bells and whistles intact and expanded upon. The game truly is a sight to behold running at 1080p and a perceptively quite stable 60fps on my big 65 inch Panasonic. A lot of people/critics are marking the game down based on the price. This is unfair in my estimation. The 'game' is still a stellar AAA title, now with just more additional sheen. The practice of keeping the price high is something I understand the community's resentment over, but as far as ridiculous scores like 60% or below for the actual game itself I do not agree with at all. If you never knew the title was released prior and sat down to play it and review it on its own merits in this incarnation you would be undeniably impressed and the score should reflect that. If you're lucky enough to have never played it and own a PS4 buy it immediately, comfortable with the fact that you just purchased the best game on the system. But even if like me you have played it, and even if you played it on the PC where the advantages this version offers are slimmer, it still is worthy of heavy consideration. I personally loved the game first time round and had zero reservations about ponying up for it again on PS4. It is a double dip, but it is also one where you can see significant care has been made to update a lot of things graphically that is truly a rarity in similar double dip scenarios, where a resolution increase is about it. 10/10...on any platform.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/tomb-raider-definitive-edition

They have delivered some bodacious titles recently.  The Shadow Warrior reboot was glorious.  Every game oozes with quality and this is no exception.  For what it is, it brings exactly what is necessary to make a quality video game on Vita.  Controls that are easy to pick up but easy to master?  Check.  Able to be played in short bursts or long marathons?  Check.  Music that compliments the gameplay?  Check (although really, why would you not play your OWN music with this?).  Interesting and/or more than adequate graphics?  Check.  All of this can be adjusted by adjusting your loadout.  Sucking too much?  Try some different gear.  Strap on that cannon and nuke armor and prepare for some residual earnings.  Too godly?  Try getting by on your farted bullets only to propel you, and some weak armor. Actually, the graphics may be one of the things that turns people off when in fact it's what keeps the game playable at higher 'levels' of gameplay.  It is easy to see your ship against the bright background as well as enemy ships, missiles, bullets, lasers, kamikazes and whatever else in bullet hell that is seeking to destroy you.  Without such contrast it would be difficult to survive.  Also, for some they may not appreciate the fact there is no story to speak of.  This is an arcade shoot 'em up.  Gameplay only. Devolver Digital is a studio that seems to really be putting some interesting ideas into play.  Although you really cant compare Luftrausers with their AAA titles - this is actually why I was not afraid at all to purchase this game for 10 chucks on PSN - the studios reputation with me. In conclusion, the price, gameplay and especially the GAME SIZE (only 66 MB!!) all lead me to give this game a ten.  It's not perfect - but factoring in the file size on top of the extreme quality of game play (plays exactly like the arcade shooters of your youth - eat your Big League Chew) it deserves it.  It almost feels like the devs are sticking it to Sony with such a tiny, quality game. Without the file size buff, a very solid '9'.  A '10' because it barely scratches your memory card, and that is something all Vita gamers can appreciate.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/luftrausers

This game pays so much homage to the beloved Ruby/Sapphire titles for the Gameboy Advance whilst keeping the game relevant for newer players with a sizeable amount of new mega evolutions, all of which are amazing fun to use. The introduction of Primal Evolution is an interesting mechanic and is executed well within the story, I just wish it had been expanded upon a bit more. Music wise, I have to say this game sticks faithful to the original games' roots while extending the themes with orchestral remixes that perfectly fit the tone. Overworld wise, not a huge deal has changed, except the world looks so much more alive in 3D, with the newly bustling Mauville being a particular highlight of the adventure, and the new Gym Puzzles being incredibly satisfying. While the game may seem easy to fans of the original game due to the Exp. Share buff to spread to all party members, this may be switched off and on at will, allowing fans of the original games to experience the same difficulty. For those who are worried about there being ""too much water"", I can reassure you that surfing speed is vastly increased in OR/AS and water routes feel smaller, so you don't feel as swamped by water as you did in Ruby and Sapphire. New mechanic wise, sneaking up on a Pokémon is a small, but welcome addition that allows access to rare Pokémon with increased stats and rare moves, and allows you to discover new Pokémon in previously explored areas. Lastly, the ""Delta Episode"" in the aftergame links perfectly with Pokémon X and Y, tying up loose ends, and ending a few hours worth of extra gameplay for old and new fans alike to enjoy, culminating in two incredible legendary captures at the end, and the announcement that all the other non-event legends are now catchable, vastly increasing replayability. Add to that the return of the PSS, Pokémon Amie, and Super Training, and you have a well-rounded package that is the perfect difficulty for newcomers, whilst holding enough depth to keep dedicated Pokémon fans hooked for months. Simply put this game is near flawless. (My only problem with this game I could find was it seemed to easy, but with Ruby and Sapphire being my favourite games, I cannot make a value judgement  as to whether this is due to experience with the original titles or not). 10/10",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/pokemon-alpha-sapphire

The story, the fast epic battles, the great voice acting. It really is a gem in the rough. Though it did have some flaws I easily put more than 100 hours in the game. When Delta was localized I was very excited. I've played so far about 5 hours and let me tell you this. If you enjoyed Soul Sacrifice, you will LOVE Delta. Its improves in every single way of SS. First thing you'll notice is a bump up in resolution. It's still not native but its a really big graphical upgrade. No more rough edges it all looks really clean. The game is absolutely gorgeuous. Next thing you'll notice is way more depth to offerings. Now you can combine attacks offering way more methods of  tackling enemys and just improves the fun ten fold. Not only that but there is also new offerings like the spear! Hard to master weapons but very satisfying to use. The new monster designs based on Grimm Fairy tales Characters are amazing. Soul Sacrifice never dissapoints in that matter. You will never look at little red riding hood again in the same way. The new level designs are just amazing and now there are more variety of smaller creatures, so no more demon cats and rats everywhere They now added a new faction to the game called Grim that appeases to those that like to stay neutral. Depending on which faction you are in you will get different offerings meaning everybody is going to have a different inventory of offerings. The story is still relatively the same, but now you have to do some grim , avalon and Sanctuary sidequest before being allowed to  play Magusars arc.  These sidequest actually act as a bridgepoint between Sortiara's and Magusars arc, expanding a bit more on the Sorcerer and his interaction with the world and other NEW sorcerers only found in Delta. Delta is a major improvement over SS in every way. If you got SS free from PS+ and loved it buy Delta now and support the devs If you bought SS and just liked it not loved it, then wait for price drop. Since its nots a full blown sequel more like a relaunch with a buttload of tweaks and improvements, making it the True SS experience. For the love of god people ignore ArioX and especially WIzard4en ""review"". The former probably thought Delta was Soul Sacrifice 2 when Inafune said many many many times it was more lik Soul Sacrifice 1.8 and the latter is just a Monster hunter fanboy enough said.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/soul-sacrifice-delta

Strongly recommend getting the Zubmariner DLC too - it's playable inside the main game story, and gives you many advantages once you've gained the ability to scour the surface, the Unterzee and the sea bed too. The game also makes a big deal about playing for permadeath, teasing the idea that it would be detrimental to use Saves and lose your status as a ""true"" player. I'd advise you to forget that, and use the Save! It's hard enough without completely crushing yourself. Abandon all ideas about finding some cheap stock that's worth a fortune at another port, too; such things are almost totally non-existent, and this isn't Elite. Money will appear as windfalls from unexpected moments in the game's story, as will life-saving food and fuel (although you will also need to buy these!).

It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition. Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability.

I really gave me the feeling that I was in the thick of it. The sense of desperation I felt here really made me question the decisions I had to make. Also, all of the work I had put into building up relationships with these characters really mattered in this episode. I really felt I had to do everything in my power to keep Clementine alive here, and that kept me very invested. However there is one key issue I found with this episode, and unlike in the previous episodes the issue isn't with a lack of gameplay. The issue I have here is that I don't really care about this new cast anywhere near as much as the old one. The only characters whose fates I actually really care about, are the ones who return from the first season. That made it hard for me to care if the majority of these new characters died, and therefore took out some of the emotion this episode could have otherwise had for me. That's not to say that I dislike the new characters, it's just that the majority of them I don't find as enjoyable as the previous season's. That being said this episode did make a few of them grow on me, so it may be only a matter of time until I like them. Overall I found this to be the best episode this season has had yet. It's tense, made me question my decisions and who to trust, and there's some actual gameplay here. Here's hoping that the last two episodes continue the upward trend. As of right now I am more excited then ever for the next episode of this season, and if they can make me care about at least the majority of the new cast in the next episode, then maybe my disappointment so far with this season will change.

Really nothing to complain about here. The difficulty is very low in the first few levels and always gets a little higher from level to level. Nobody should have any problems getting into the game. And yet it is quite challenging later on. Escape Goat 1 offered some high difficulty levels after beating the campaign. I expect the successor to offer the same (I didn't finish it yet, so I just can assume it will). The main difference to the first part is the graphics style. Instead of the basic pixel art we got in Escape Goat 1, this game now uses a new high definition graphics style, which many people will like. I personally prefer the old art style, but I am fine with either of them. The most important thing for me is, that the controls didn't change at all. Despite the new graphics the game feels absolutely like the first part. Not all games manage to do that. I like it a lot. Both Escape Goat games are real indie gems.

I am hoping my wife will give it a shot since she is the painter/drawer in the family.  This could be a game that could unite the family in a fun activity... imagine family competitions? Pros+Easy to pick up and follow+Great drawing lessons+Plenty of tools for creative types+Great replay-ability Cons- Not a traditional Pokemon game- May not be suitable for young artists Bottom Line:  If you know someone that is into Pokemon AND loves to draw, this is a no-brainer.  If the person you want to get this game does not enjoy drawing, then stay clear away from it because even if they are a Pokemon fan, they may hate you for not getting them an actually Pokemon game.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/pokemon-art-academy

I prefer no power bar, no chalk, no gimmicks, just Pure Pool! I find the table very good so each to their own opinion, lets meet up and have a few games online!  There are server issues with launch which they are fixing and is not anything to do with the game itself but rather the servers... I also agree it is harder to play opponents who are like minded and don't use aids etc, it seems you need to create a League or know your opponent and challenge them, the Quick Match I never used in HK since it would match me up with full aiming lines! Interestingly I played Virtual Pool 3 and Virtual Pool Hall a lot on the PC and was involved in the world leagues, I was ranked 9th at one point many moons ago...but never played 4... Original Review: I disagree with pithing_needle...I play pool for my pub team and this pool simulation is by far the nearest thing I've ever played on a console to real life. The game drips in quality and oozes class. The 1080p and 60fps does it justice but the game itself feels very right when you play it. I found the table speed very good, I felt the amount of power I pulled back with on the cue reflected what I wanted to do in the shot and love the fact that aiming lines are not so accurate. I much prefer no aiming lines but the angle you view the shots with can be hard to judge so the little circle makes sense so you can at least tell which side of the object ball you are hitting. Online play was smooth and seamless...I too would prefer to weed out those using a line but there must be a way to do this. In Hustle Kings if you went to a Quick Match you got a random person who may have used lines too but then in HK you could create rooms that specified no aiming lines. More time is needed on Pure Pool. This is by the far the best pool simulation game ever and deserves a 10/10 for me.

I found this game to be something really special. It takes the fundamentals of the played out shooter genre (which I actually am a fan of) and adds a ridiculous theme from one of my favorite mobile games. But besides my personal interests, the game itself is actually incredibly well designed and Ill cut to the chase.Pros:-Fun for all ages-Lots of customization and character variation (4 classes per side, type variations for each class and ability)Peashooter and Fire PeashooterAllstar and Hockey player version-Exciting game modes=Team Death Match (Feels right at home)Garden and Graveyards (Simplified version of BF rush mode)Gnome Bomb (Comparable to BF Obliteration mode)Suburbanization (Domination)Taco Bandits (Kinda like CTF, Zombies try to steal a taco from plants 3 times)-Free Updates (The last one included the latter 2 game modes and tons of customization items)-Easy to play/ Not stressfulThe game was my saving grace from games like Battlefield or KZ Shadow Fall (Still play them). Honestly its hard to be mad at this game.. Sure some idiot on your team will bring the taco back towards the plants but its just so lighthearted and silly that you'll probably just laugh. I hope.-Everything feels very well balancedWhether in TDM or a completely attack and defend game mode like G&G or Taco, the game never really feels too unbalanced. One team may out rank the other round continuously win but the design of the game is very even across the board. Zombies geared to attack and plants better for defending like they are supposed to but it just works.-Garden Ops (Horde mode)This is actually a lot different from the main multiplayer and its a great change up. The goal is to survive 10 waves and escape aboard Crazy Dave's flying RV. The game is fun and really focuses on the team working together and having a good balance of classes. The amount of maps and locations within each one plus the variety of bonus waves and bosses keeps this fresh and fun. Cons:-No single player storyI haven't been a huge fan of really any FPS story but I feel with the setting of this and the characters they could have actually made an engaging campaign. Hell you could have done two with perspectives from the zombies and plants alike.. I guess its probably better that they left it out rather then screwed it up but maybe in a sequel.-Garden Ops, unlike my experience in Multiplayer, can get very buggy which needs a tune up. Not always though thankfully. This game is some serious fun and a real change from the mundane other FPS games you might be playing. It is great for literally anyone and I would recommend it highly. Trying to not be biased and see it from all perspectives I do think this game deserves a higher score than it has. It might have a few bug issues that could be fixed but as a whole it is very well built, almost surprisingly so. Because I expect a fix to the problems in Garden Ops and that is the only bad thing in my mind this get a 10/10. Play it. Its fun.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare

When the characters wear a given costume, they get, more or less, the powers associated with that particular character.

Levels range from straight-up zombie swatting, to vehicle races, to hostage rescues, to boss fights. Missions generally come strung together in a series, with players scored against each other based on achievements, and and also as a team. Power-ups and weapons abound, and players can build their personal power-up bars by killing zombies, unleashing their special moves once the bar is charged up. And many zombies will be killed in Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha.

When I first heard about Hack 'n' Slash, it was during Double Fine's in house ""Amnesia Fortnight"" game jam. The amnesia fortnight is a tradition of double fine which has brought on some really interesting games such as costume quest, the cave, and space base. While I will admit the tradition can be frustrating when it breaks up a team working on a larger game like ""Broken Age""(which may have been inspired by past game jams), thus slowing production, however the fortnight event keeps the creativity in their studio flowing and provides motivation for the designers to keep making inventive games for us to enjoy (so we should promise not to complain). The Game itself is a legend of zelda-esque dungeon puzzler, but instead of the ever-present block pushing puzzles which are so indicative of the genre it is made up of puzzles based off of lua script coding. According to the developers, the game is still a little bit of a work in progress, given the complaints of difficulty on the later portions of the game I feel that this statement is corroborated. The latter half of the game has a steep increase in difficulty of code primarily due to the open-ended-ness of the game itself. While it may sound like lazy coding, the designers still wanted to keep the open endedness and difficulty to foster a community rather than hinder it. The intent of the game is to bring together veteran-coders, fledgling designers and script kitties to create a community similar to that of any game design group to foster creativity and modification to take what is already there and make something more. I personally feel that if t succeeds, this game will be an important point in gaming history when developers learn to let their audience collaborate with them on an even deeper level. I give this game a high review for aiming high, and suggest it to anyone even slightly interested in any form of programming. I want as many people as possible to play this game so that the community can grow and build something history-making out of something already beautiful.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/hack-n-slash

But despite its shortcomings, Mousecraft hits its gameplay spot on, featuring a very good (if not a tad aggressive) difficulty progression, thoughtfully developed levels, and novel elements that keep puzzles fresh and entertaining during gameplay progression. In Mousecraft, you control the composition of a level, by placing or destroying blocks, in order to get three mice from a starting point to the goal. Both the ability to place items in levels or destroy items is limited making often requiring extremely precise choices to complete a level with a perfect score. If the game had one major flaw it would be that levels can be completed without collecting all items and getting all mice to the goal. While this may have been a mechanism to allow the gamer to choose their own difficulty, completing a level with less than perfect is often very unsatisfying, allowing the gamer to progress quickly through levels thus robbing the gamer of the feeling of satisfaction having bested a challenging puzzle, making further progression a daunting endeavor. The second flaw is less important, though may be responsible for the games tepid reception -- the graphics. The game is drab and the characters uninspired. Mousecraft may have gotten much higher scores had it featured characters like Super Mario's Toad with a ""Super Mario 3D World"" aesthetic -- staunchly implying that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the game; it is very fun, challenging, and well-designed. But superficially it is easy to pre-judge and hence approach the title with a negative bias. I urge those that enjoy light puzzles to approach Mousecraft with an open mind and to complete each level with a perfect score before progressing. You may find it to be very fun and satisfying, and may ultimately determine that the game is criticized incommensurately with its shortcomings.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/mousecraft

The game is very forgiving on the lower difficulties and significantly less so on the higher difficulties. On all of them however it is at least somewhat complex, requiring some degree of planning and common sense from you. There are no green arrows that tell you where you should go next. At the same time it's not entirely without direction, as NPCs will tell you about other regions of the world. Many call this game linear because ""Titanic"" encounters block all the ""incorrect"" paths. First, those are blocking shortcuts and not paths. Second, most of them are defeatable early anyways even on the highest difficulty allowing for a great deal of sequence breaking at least on par with that of a Souls game. The second thing a lot of people have trouble with is the presentation. Yes, the graphics are simple and the animations a bit clunky. This is an indie game made on a tiny budget and one of the very few Early Access success stories that exist. Sacrifices must be made. Likewise the story is fairly generic... this game is focused on the game mechanics first and everything else second and as a result the core game is solid. The third thing is the difficulty. As I mentioned the low difficulties are very forgiving. A lot of modern gamers will struggle even there as even the ""Casual"" difficulty still demands something from you and most modern games do not. Exercise even a little forethought however and you'll be right at home on the middle difficulty for your first run and either after completing it, or hitting the halfway point and finding it easy you can then charge right back in on the highest difficulty and complete that. And then if that's STILL easy, some crazy guy (me) is making a mod that makes it harder still. I've easily gotten 450 hours out of this game and I am nowhere near done with it.

To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won't be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there's one thing you can truly say about this game, it's that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it's based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can't fight as them, at the very least you're likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game's menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game's release was such an affair that the game itself had it's own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks. The game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it's core is a pretty solid fighter. It's not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren't going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don't play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos. One thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with ""Chummiiii!"" sounds), you can use all of Mista's Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they're going to say next. As I've said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it's a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff ""Polnareff"" even if the subtitles say ""Eiffel"". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you've read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out ""Stone Free!"" or Giorno saying ""Gold Experience Requiem!"" among others. Overall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, you're just depriving yourself if you don't buy this game. If you're a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend's house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I'd give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/jojos-bizarre-adventure-all-star-battle

The reasons for this are: 1) Obnoxiously long load times (Dustforce on PC had no loading screens, at all). It takes around a minute to get from initial boot to the hub world. On PC, it took about two seconds. I am not exaggerating.2) No cross-buy (PS3 and Vita versions are separate games).3) Framerate is jumpy. This becomes much worse when moving quickly.4) Audio lag. You can't go a whole minute without hearing some form of audio lag. Also, the audio lags consistently at the end of every run, and while attacking enemies at higher speeds.5) The new UI looks cheap and out-of-place.6) No custom controls.7) The clipping is off. I watched myself pass through objects that should have been solid several times on the PS3 version.8) Absolutely none of the previously listed issues are present on the PC version of the game. If future updates fix these issues, I will change my rating to a 10. Anyways, lets all thank Q-loc and Capcom taking a truly superb platforming experience and slaughtering it before the eyes of the console community.

But anyhow, Anomaly Defender can be reduced to a puzzle even if there is some tension in selecting the right place for towers since they occupy more or less space. The strange thing about Anomaly Warzone is that, in spite of its qualities, the gameplay becomes sometimes repetitive, the most intense moment being the beginning of each level where you analyse and plan your towers placement, then simply repair and upgrade them as the human forces grow stronger. There is really a radical loss of pacing compared the Warzone serie, in which you have to constantly re-route your squad, run for energy ressources or carefully place abilities like Repair. This might be an example of the difference between a game like Anomaly Warzone with a novel and solid core concept that can sustain even a barely good execution ; and a game like Anomaly Defenders who spawns inside an established genre, without an outstanding concept, but with proven ideas and a good execution.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/anomaly-defenders

It’s a game that is as unique as you will find, with a tone that feels like the love child of Tim Burton & Lewis Carroll with the colour palette of an old sketched children’s book. Our little protagonist ‘Baby’ as she is known is quite unlike anything else out out there. She is a seemingly malformed nightmare child that wouldn’t seem out of place in Alice in Wonderland or a Brothers Grimm tale. She also has a lot of personality for a character with no actual dialogue. I love how her expressions can be just as strong through the eyes and little gasps or garbled noises she makes. The premise is simple, we must guide ‘Baby’ back home, aided only by our little love heart balloon and itchy trigger fingers on the Vita’s touchscreen. Murasaki Baby utilises the Vita’s touchpad in such a fantastic way, you won’t control anything in this game by the D-pad or right buttons, and it works flawlessly. You guide Baby literally by holding her hand with your index finger through each level. You help her jump over ledges, tap out enemies as well as flip between backgrounds that drastically change the game’s dynamic with the Vita’s rear touchpad . This is a puzzle platformer through and through with each background we flip causing different things to appear or creating new actions that can be performed. For instance, jumping between ledges may require quick flicks of the touchpad to create new ledges and a sharp memory to remember which background will create our next step. Everything from causing thunderstorms to controlling a huge beast to wreak havoc with mini earthquakes are present, and this creates a really cool dynamic in the game, especially when all these elements begin to intertwine later in the game. Director Massimo Guarini (Shadows of The damned, Killer7) nails a truly unique setting and atmosphere. The theme of protector is strong, and as a player you genuinely feel compelled to help guide Baby back to safety through the dark surroundings and shadows that linger around her. It’s also a land of enemies and sights that remind me of what scared me as a child and I really love how the game struck a chord like that for me , even if it is a creepy one. Another standout feature of the game is the unsettling, yet intricate score by Gianni Ricciardi and Silent Hill’s Akira Yamaoka. It is tense, dark and foreboding and superbly supports the tone and sense of immersion. Like a lot of cool indie games of late (Child of Light, Journey and Hohokum spring to mind) it is a better score than most AAA games on the market right now. Overall, Murasaki Baby is a little indie gem for Sony’s underrated handheld. It’s a game that feels like director Guarini has left it’s underlying themes of loss and despair up to individual interpretation. It certainly hit me in a personal way and I’m sure it will for you too. www.doyouevengamebro.net",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/murasaki-baby

The graphics are old school, but frankly, that only adds to its allure. If you like top down bullet-hell Rogue-likes (think Binding of Isaac, but with more bullets), then you will love this. Don't be fooled by the graphics; Runers comes with a ton of content. Not only are there hundreds of different rune combinations and spells, there is also an insane variety of enemies and bosses, and a ton of customizability, offered by your starting choices and then your randomized trait offerings as you level up and enter new floors. This game will not let you rest. You will not grow lax while playing this game. You will be dodging madly, holding down the mouse madly and slamming your fingers down on keys, trying to outrace the frenetic speed of the game. The difficulty scales nicely through the game, and there are five different levels for all kinds of players. This is an amazing Rogue-like that uses every bit of its potential to shine brightly. It's pretty easy to get over the graphics when the gameplay draws one in so completely. It is basically glitch-free, with nothing game-crashing, and has an amazing amount of randomization and customizability. Each game you play, you will gain experience, knowledge of new spells and rune combinations, and hopefully a few more spells for your RuneDex. You'll get small but not-completely-insignificant in-game boosts and understanding of enemies and patterns, and you will build upon your past games to get better in future ones. This game has seemingly infinite replay value and is just amazing. I recommend it anyone who likes Roguelikes, bullet hells, or even just good, solid replay value. This has the potential to become a classic with a fan following rivaling that of Binding of Isaac.

I highly recommend this wonderful, unique experience to anyone who falls under either, or both, genres this game sets out to be: a Pinball RPG. 1. Gameplay & Story2. Graphics & Visuals3. Music & Sound4. Replay & Extras5. Is this game for you? 1. Gameplay & StoryThere is, indeed, a story from beginning to end. The introduction tells a tale of war, survival, and prophecy. As most highly acclaimed titles, the story and game progression come hand in hand. There are various ACTS in the game, each offering STAGES with unique, entertaining challenges. Some range from “defeat all enemies” to “find the exit”. Each character is a ball and you can switch them on the fly by “cradling” them in your main flippers. This adds variety and strategy, especially if you choose to revisit a stage to grind for gold or XP. As you progress through the game you gain more allies, who all have pros and cons similar to any traditional RPG roster (Rogue, Healer, Knight, etc.). You can slightly move your character as he/she is on the play field. The Knight is heavier, so he is harder to control but strikes like a beast. The Rogue is smaller and agile, so you can almost completely curve the trajectory of her launch. Clever puzzles include holding a flipper to allow your ball to pass under it, or bumping torches with your ball to light a room. The game mechanics run deeper as the story progresses, from your flippers having HP, managing your Mana to either resurrect fallen allies or activate special abilities, or hiring an additional character (in other words, purchasing an additional life). Learning the mechanics as the game progresses is part of the fun, so I won’t spoil any further details. 2. Graphics & VisualsRollers is a beautiful blend of comic-panel illustrations (cinematics) and a deep, fully realized world developed in 3D, presented in an over-head pinball perspective. Enhanced by music and sound, the visual experience brings you into a realm of wild animals, kingdoms, war and tyranny. Dark dungeons and caves are hard to see, only to be lit by torches when activated. The artists must have had a lot of fun creating logs, trees, rocks, land and architecture, all playing an important role in these pinball mazes. Make a quick Internet search and you will see the stunning environments, lighting and effects for yourself, all at a buttery-smooth 60fps. 3. Music & SoundEpic scores fill the game, beginning with a heroic theme drawing you in at the title screen. Long-awaited battles, celebration and excitement are met with grand reprises. There is a strong cast of characters with full, convincing voice-overs that bring the characters to life. Not only are the actors amazing, I need to hand it to the casting director who did a brilliant job. Each character has a distinguishable ethnicity, age and backstory that you can tell just from the voice alone, from a middle-aged monk to an older alchemist. 4. Replay & ExtrasEach stage can be revisited for various “set ups”. Perfect for RPG fans who love to grind for XP and loot. Many stages have hidden keys, which unlocks a hidden treasure. If you’re looking to unlock everything in the game, there are characters to hire, items to purchase and equip, and challenges to clear, unlocking even more items. Everything you unlock enhances your party, which like any good RPG, leaves you feeling rewarded towards the end having managed an even stronger party. 5. Is this game for you?I’ve never been a fan of traditional pinball games. I can appreciate the high-score appeal, but I’ve always wanted a more compelling reason to play, and Rollers offered something unique. It’s a very ambitious game, and breaks traditional conventions, but the developers at Phantom Compass dared to do it. And it works. From the moment I realized that I had to use the back-side of a flipper to find that hidden key, to the hours I’ve spent eagerly grinding for “one more level... one more level” before challenging that next boss, I’ve never had this much fun with a Pinball game before. There have been several pinball action titles that could fall under the same category, such as Sonic Spinball or Mario Pinball Land, but Rollers has perfected the genre in 2014 adding unprecedented, original features, polished so well that no other developer can even touch them. During development, they were picked-up by Atlus, which in my books add to their credibility. If you’re a hardcore fan of Puzzle, Pinball or Role Playing Games, Rollers of the Realm is a true gem that belongs in your gaming library. The game is so original, you could give it its own genre: The Roll Playing Game.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/rollers-of-the-realm

My 10 year-old then took on the role as the fox. For the next hour, as a family, we had an absolute blast playing, but also watching the videos about the Inupiat people that are embedded into the game.  We especially liked the one about the Arctic Fox. It was very rewarding to watch the two of them work together to solve the puzzles that the game presented.  Soon enough, we were mimicking the noise Nuna makes when the fox ""dies"", and of course we needed to sing ""What Does the Fox Say?"". I will say though, that the polar bear and the ""fireman"" were a bit scary to them.  We would try to lessen the scariness of the ""fireman"" by mimicking what he does when he ""catches up"" with Nuna (he reaches down, grabs her bola and thrusts it powerfully into the air). Probably my daughters favorite part of the game was watching Nuna and the Fox swim, or (SPOILER ALERT) watching the boy fox fly. If there are parents out there searching for a game to buy their young daughters, they should look no further than Never Alone.

Let's start with MP. For me, the on disc maps in Ghosts are among the worst in COD history. They're just too big for the tiny player cap. These DLC maps seek to fix this. The maps are small to medium sized and actually play surprisingly well. They're fast, frenetic, and actually fun, with the campy horror film inspired map, Fog, being among one of my favorites in all of COD DLC. The only blemish is the map Containment which feels like a map that was supposed to originally ship with the game. It's slow, there's too many spots to camp, and is just kinda boring to play. The new weapons; The Maverick and The Maverick A2, are lackluster. A slow and clunky assault rifle, and an unbalanced sniper variant make for a disappointing weapon DLC. Now we move on to the shining light in an overall average pack... Nightfall. Nightfall is a massive improvement over Point of Contact. However, newer players beware! This map is incredibly difficult compared to its rather tame predecessor, and actually took me quite some time to master. The story of Nightfall is actually really solid and is surprisingly well fleshed out through the collectible intel scattered around the map. These intel logs feature something that the main campaign mode lacked... capable voice actors and characters with some motivation and reason. The new boss cryptid; the breeder, is sadly, very under utilized. It's nothing more than a very generic boss fight that borders on unfair at times. Despite this, the ending cutscene of the map is very interesting, and really makes me excited to see where the story will go in ""Mayday"". Overall, Onslaught is an average DLC, but the new Extinction experience really is something special. Fans of Ghosts will be left feeling like they got their moneys worth, but those who weren't a fan of Ghosts should probably steer clear.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/call-of-duty-ghosts---onslaught

Their racers always provide accessibility over realism. They always have. I wouldn't expect that to change anytime soon. Put simply, they tend to make racing games, not driving games. If u want a hyper-real, exclusively open-wheel driving sim, you probably need to look into a desktop computer. That's just how it goes, i'm afraid. When it comes to videogames, open wheel racing just isn't as popular as Touring Car racing. Open wheel cars tend to be an addition, even an afterthought, rather than a focus on consoles. I'm not saying it's right, just that it's true. Even rally is  bigger draw on consoles than open-wheel. Personally, i'd love an Indycar & F[n] console sim, but they just don't exist. However, if you just want a hardcore driving sim (and if you can give up on the F1 fanboy stuff) Simbin's Racepro is available on the 360, it features a fair amount of open wheel racing, and it genuinely expects the player to have some real-world experience lapping real cars on real tracks. Best of all, it works pretty well with a controller, so you can have that ""Track-Day-On-The-Couch: experience without buying a $200 wheel/pedal/sequential shifter setup, or a $10,000 computer. For me personally, Forza Motorsport does the best job of capturing the feel of driving the actual cars offered in the game. I run an '00 S2000 and i test drive cars for fun, (cuz i'm a giant fkn lame-ass and am lucky enough to have very supportive, extremely understanding women in my life) so you can take my word for it, if you're so inclined. The whips all feel like they should in FM. The weight is in the right places, the engine and transmission quirks are what and where they should be, the suspension reacts just right, (ie: old 911s shuffle erratically, newer elises' understeer a bit if u don't know how to drive the, the original S2000s are as agile and as twitchy and as telepathic as they are IRL, the acceleration in an M5 feels...almost bizarre in contrast to the weight and size, &c), and even the grip gives out in the right places at the right speeds...provided your tires are comprable to the tires you have equipped in the game. You can actually buy a tuner mag and apply the setup, down to the numbers, to yer forza motorsport car and you'll achieve whatever it is yer trying to achieve with your tuning. And the AI is the best in the business. It adapts to you. If you have problems with the AI in FM, it's cuz you don't understand track racing. No offense intended. I'll explain what u mean. For example, if you play bumpercars to win, expect Forza's AI to PIT you right back. But if you respect racing rules and etiquette, giving way when yer line is lost, not brake checking at every corner &c, the AI will treat you with the same respect. In fact, choosing one driver to hassle is a fun way to create a heated rivalry over time. Simply, the Drivatar system is damn amazing. (Note that all this is NOT true for Forza Horizon, which is really good fun, but feels more like a Gran Tourismo or Grid Autosport or NFS Shift, in so much as the cars feel like they OUGHT to, based on the setup and balance and power, but NOT what they actually feel like IRL.) But Forza Motorsport is also a very forgiving driving game. Lift-off in a front drive automatic isn't an automatic trip to the wall, for example. Now, I don't have the credit score to test drive a Gumpert (if that's even possible...) but as far as a console game that requires you to really understand and be constantly aware of the physics and engineering behind driving a purpose built track car, RacePro is as good as it gets on any console, and you don't even need a wheel, which is amazing, frankly. Plus, as i mentioned previously, you get open wheel racing. Not the full on hump-the-leg F1 experience, but...honestly, all the fanboy stuff, (like complaining that the game is balanced just because mercedes had a great year) reminds me a lot of cosplay. Probably best to just go get an SCCA license or some tickets if it's really that important to you. No stay at home experience will ever satisfy that type of obsession. When it's that serious, it's the real deal or medication. (Really, not trying to be mean, just realistic. Give RacePro a shot. It has the F3000 license, among others, and that's as close as normal humans can get.) If there's a better true sim for consoles, please tell me. I'll buy it tonight. In the meantime, this is a cartoon of F1. It's good fun, and i even have the Vita version, but it's not really good enough to make me wanna buy it instead of one of the many other options. It's only because i already have all the other options that this game appeared on my radar at all. But i don't dress up as Zombie Senna for Halloween. (Best driver ever. Before you make hate-face and say Schumacher, he also thinks Senna is the best driver ever.)",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/f1-2014

It plays a bit like Muramasa Rebirth on the Vita, in that you can't button-mash your way though the game, and is one of the most atmospheric, and beautiful side-scrolling adventure games i've ever played. Some games are a labor of love, some are a concept brought to life to life by pad professionals, and some are a callous attempt to profit off of a recycled idea. This game is a labor of love, and that shows. It makes the experience feel... special, somehow. Intimate. I'm no graphics whore, but this game is freakin' beautiful. And it's fun, once you get used to it's little quirks. As a side scroller, it doesn't hold up to the fluidity of a Shadow Complex or Mark of the Ninja, but by the same token, one could say that DMC4 isn't as fluid as ninja theory's DMC reboot, or that Virtua Fighter isn't as smooth as Blazblue, or that FFTactics isn't as smooth as XCom. In reality, they're just different. And ""different"", my beloved colleagues, is a good thing. If nothing else, it's definitely worth DLing the demo and spending some time learning and experiencing the game. If you enjoy it, buy it.

However there are certain spots in some levels which require what I'd call ""trained eye"" to pass. It isn't a fundamental fault in the game but some people might think that it's a fault in the level design. There's a slight learning curve associated with the game. The game lacks proper integration with the Steam. There are no achievements, no Steam cards, and no support for SteamOS/Linux and/or OS X. Also the graphics settings menu uses slightly obscure English which makes it bit difficult to adjust the graphics to look as good as possible and requires bit of trial and error. There is also no global Steam scoreboard which means you cannot compete with your friends in ladders. All in all REDUX is a really fun shoot em' up. It doesn't offer anything new to the genre but rather plays it safe by making sure that all the basic fundamental things are executed as well as possible.

I own all F1 games from Codemasters, and I consider this iteration of simcade F1 cars to be the most challenging, interesting, and enjoyable to drive. The biggest difference?  If you push too hard into a turn and slam the brakes in a desperate attempt to still hit the apex, the front wheels DO NOT lockup and the cars DO NOT understeer straight off the track.  Instead the cars have braking oversteer which can lead to a 4-tire-drift around the apex, which requires accurate throttle/brake input and appropriate steering to correct and minimize the time lost.  That's right, these F1 cars like to drift under aggressive deceleration.  And that is incredibly more fun than locking up the Pirilli's and cutting a chicane to regain control and speed.  Is it accurate to the real motorsport?  Perhaps not, but it's considerably more fun. Second biggest difference: Holy crap, the torque.  I haven't driven every car yet, but if you load up that rear axle mid turn on a sweeper while pounding up through the gears, full throttle will result in lighting up the rear tires.  Throttle control is critical; turns that were flat in F1 2013 now require some throttle manipulation to keep the car on the a fast racing line.  You can also go deep into the rev's without losing too much acceleration, a pleasant situation because the gear ratios are fixed. Why are people not talking about these improvements to car handling and the positive impact it has on the gameplay?  I imagine most people use a joypad, and I don't know how these changes translate a stick and a couple triggers.  Or if they have a wheel and pedal setup, they keep some driving assists on, completely negating the fun of pushing the fastest cars in the world while exploring the limits of grip. As for what everyone else is saying:  Yes, in general there is less content and Codemasters should have anticipated this response.  But if you have the racing peripherals and the skills to drive with all assists off, you will be surprised at how much fun it is to toss a Codies F1'14 car around the race tracks. 10/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/f1-2014

Yes the game is a little rough around the edges and it’s quite hard.   But to be honest so are other good Japanese games; the Darksouls games for example.  Yes, the story isn’t amazing, yes it is missing a vast tutorial system that explains all the small nuances that you will need to know to survive the higher difficulties, but even with these flaws there are very well executed parts to it as well.  For instance, the combat and customization are unlike any other title on the vita.  Disgaea 3 - 4 might be close in terms of complexity, but it isn’t truly 3d combat like ND is.  Also, because you have a smaller party, you feel more invested in the characters and in different instances you have to utilize those characters in drastically different ways due to which types you have available at the time.Pulling off a successful Initiative chain is both fun and gratifying especially if you can do it for an entire map.  (Yes, this is possible, but very difficult.). Being able to swap camera angles helps quite a bit with the line of sight which for the most part is spot on.  This leads into the verticality of the game which can be the life or death of your party.  Using gunners to pick off people from a height or sieging an area of the map to gain this advantage makes the game feel truly strategic and allows for multiple strategies to be used to secure a win.   The graphics are very gritty with sharp edges but they work very well for this type of game and also look spectacular on the vita’s smaller screen.  While you will find yourself moving through similar looking terrain for a large period of the game, the maps tend to have their own lay outs and interesting mechanics.  The Co-op and multiplayer parts of this game are also very welcome additions to what seems to be a very long single player experience, you can make decks of monsters/units and customize your own army to whatever strategy you think will work well (though there are very few people who are online right now).Anyhow, if you enjoy Tactical Role playing games and want a challenge, Natural Doctrine is a great title to help you scratch that itch.  It is my opinion that turn based games such as this work better on mobile systems then twitched based games with some exceptions (platformers, simple hack and slash style RPGs etc).  I didn’t like borderlands 2 or Killzone because they didn’t feel to play very comfortably on the mobile platform, whereas games like  Ys, Muramasa, persona 4, Disgaea 3-4 and Danganrompa are perfect for this little device.  I will be adding Natural Doctrine to that list, I hope to see more people online to help give the game more longevity.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/natural-doctrine

Finish line did a great job recreating it. There were changes I noticed that at first I though were done by Finish line but they said later it they were from the Overdrive edition no one heard of. I saw they tweaked a few things like the hazards and weapons to eliminate some frustrating parts. Of course I still question it was a good idea to add the health bar. I mean it's good not to be instakilled so quickly but I you have too much health that it takes too long to kill someone. Anyway the other issue that was obvious was there way no online multiplayer which this game really could use. They said it was cause the game did not originally have that and adding it would be to expensive at this point. Of course that didn't mean they didn't want to. They hope the game gets big enough that they soon could add it in the future. Overall it's great to have this game again and hope they do eventually add online play.,https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/cel-damage-hd

You either love it, or you are not a real geek, just some normie poser. There are all the right ingredients in there - complicated and unintuitive (yet perfectly functional) combat system, cheesy C-movies story, japanese graphics stylization, multiplayer  thats actually not bad at all AND it looks like a PS2 game on your PS4. If you watch weird forgotten movies every once in a while, if you love reading books by evil people just to glimpse into their mind, if you have to censor your own joke ideas when your are outside your tiny social bubble, well maybe its time to take the trial. Still unsure if you should buy this game? Then go buy it! In the worst case  you waste a few bucks, but it is possible that you will fall in love. Just like I did. To add some criticism - the game is not long enough and not challenging enough. It only looks chalenging at first glance because you don't get the combat system, but once you get into it, you can sweep the floor with it wtih some effort. Luckily I just learned that there is a DLC thats supposedly BRUTAL. Going for it right now. So it's it 10/10 by me. Not because this game has no flaws, but because it is perfect as it is in a sense. When someone outside the target audience (the geek inner circle) gets his hands on it, he is repulsed away.

With a plot so deep, I discovered new emotions I didn't even know existed. There was never a moment that I wasn't eagerly anticipating the next unveiling. Yet, I didn't mind waiting, as the gameplay was far too enjoyable. I may have been a virgin before playing Bit Boy!! Arcade, but I'd be lying if I said this incredible experience didn't change that.

The AI is competent, the numerous weapons feel powerful and deadly. The environments are interesting and good looking, the portraits and merc personalities are great, the music is excellent and really sets the mood and pacing, and the sound design, especially on the weapons, is meaty and loud, and hits you right in the gut - like firearms are supposed to. Yes, there are still some rough edges, but these will be ironed out by the developers; updates have been released almost every day since release - based on testing and community feedback. And yes, some die-hard JA2 1.13 fans have been complaining about Flashback not having the same amount of features as the old games. But this game was never intended to be a clone or a remake of 1.13; that mod has been honed and fine tuned over a period of more than a decade, and the initial budget for Flashback would never be able to incorporate all that. But the core game experience is there. It's solid and fun, and the modding community seems to be really positive about the future potential of making something akin to a modern take of 1.13. Instead of complaining about missing features, people should be focusing on what this game does well and whether it's a good and fun gaming experience at its core. And it IS! Just look at Shanga's positive review above/below. He was one of the guys behind the JA2 1.13 mod. If HE is positive about the game and its future modding potential, that should count for a lot. TLDR; If you're looking for a great, tactical, and turn-based experience, this is the game for you. And it will only get better in the future - with both solid developer support and solid modding activity. I'm giving this a 9 based on the overall game experience combined with the future potential for making that even better through modding.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/jagged-alliance-flashback

The new hero is awesome, combat varied, the exploration worthwhile (you never know when you will find a new great weapon or a legendary item), piracy is still there, as in Risen 2, but it's not a main theme anymore - merely a storytelling tool - and works great. The framerate is much more stable than in previous games and the graphics is, I'd say, on par with Skyrim or Witcher 2. To be honest I didn't expect this game to be SO GOOD - after a rather boring introduction the game picks up the pace and I just couldn't stop playing at times.
