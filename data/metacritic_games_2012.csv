The moments the characters share with each other is the core foundation of the story, and their team dynamic is what makes this game so special.The school trips and social events are also a very big part of the game and they flesh out the characters more.The gameplay is pretty solid and enjoyable, it's your typical Turn Based JRPG gameplay with some very few unique elements, but the menus are a little bit clunky.The social simulator aspect is easily the best part of the gameplay, I absolutely love going out with people and partaking in events, doing the little side stories and interacting with the world the game has to offer.As for the music, it's fantastic, I honestly didn't think I would like the music of this game as much because it's not my type of music, but it fits very well, it's light-hearted and a contradiction to the game's themes, in an excellent way.The only problem I have with the game is the bad and lazy dungeon design, and the backtracking gets tedious after a while. Every area looks identical to each other, there are pretty much no puzzles, and the floors are randomly generated.Also some plot-points are kind of goofy and very sudden, which left me with some unanswered questions. That being said I think most of the story is honestly very interesting, and I love how the game delves deeper into the ""murder mystery"" theme, giving you choices to uncover the secrets of Inaba.Where the game shines is the atmosphere, at times it's surprisingly disturbing but for the most part it's very welcoming. The color palette is warm, cute and unique, making you really feel immersed into the game, spending time with the characters and participating in the story.It has a ""family"" vibe to it like no other game, and it feels like home.Despite the few outdated mechanics, I absolutely adore this game and it's definitely one of the best JRPGs I've ever played.Final Rating: ""Excellent"" - 9.5/10.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/persona-4-golden

Each ball, hit, pitch...play carries its own spin. Where and how you hit the baseball affects the spin on the ball which in turn makes each hop, bounce and hit off the bat lifelike and completely unpredictable. Your games will keep you at the edge of your seat as the game forces each ounce of your attention.

The more coins you collect in a level, the more notes will play in that level. Speaking of the music, it is incredible. The upbeat and snazzy electronica in earlier levels and the slower alternative tunes in later levels make for the best sounding game on the vita to date. Graphically this is a very unique looking game. It is simple, but detailed, and the spartan, almost minimalist style resulted in one of the prettiest platformers ive seen. In terms of gameplay, sounds shapes plays extremely similarly to most other side-scrolling platformers. You move forwards and backwards with the D-pad or the analogue stick depending on your preference, and you can also jump with the x button. Nothing new there. However, there are a few wrinkles that the formula. Your character, a blob, can stick to certain surfaces. This allows the blob to move up and down walls and even move backwards and forwards while upside-down. The blob also has two different modes: blob mode and ball mode. Blob mode is the mode that allows you to stick to surfaces etc., but while in ball mode, you can't stick to surfaces or move up walls, but you can move a lot faster and jump much further. Blob mode is the default mode and you can switch to ball mode at any time by pressing and holding square or R1.  There is really not a lot wrong with this game. It looks fantastic, sounds, fantastic and plays fantastic. There are a few small gripes, some of the levels are not particularly creative or enjoyable for instance, but that's pretty much the only negative I have. It is also of stupendous value (especially if you own both the ps3 and ps vita). The main campaign isn't very lengthy only lasting about two and a half hours. their are five ""albums"" with around four multi-part levels each. But don't worry. Sound shapes has tonnes of replay value. With a fully featured level creator and extra modes that are unlocked once the campaign has been completed. The level creator is definitely a very strong part of the game. It might not have quite the complexity or potential of little big planet 2, but it's simpler to create good levels in sound shapes, even if you're like me and are no good at level making. My biggest issue with the level creator is that some of the rear touch controls to spin objects around on the ps vita version, but it's only a minor flaw and the rest of the touch and rear touch controls in the level creator work surprisingly well. Another thing that greatly adds to the replay value are the modes you unlock once you've beaten the main campaign: beat school and death mode. Beat school is a collection of twelve levels in which you are dropped in the level creator grid and a bit of music plays in the background. In beat school, each square on the grid is a different note. Your objective is to find out what the notes are and work out where they are on the grid. it's a fun distraction for a while and a good way of earning some trophies, but the real focus here is death mode. In death mode, you must collect a certain number of coins in a small area of a level while under a time limit. It's RIDICULOUSLY hard and there are tonnes of obstacles. you have to dart around the area like mad jumping and grabbing coins. There's a deathmode level for every campaign level and this is sure to keep Hardcore platforming fans and trophy hunters like me busy. Sound shapes is definitely one of the gems of the playstation network. It's an absolute bargain at £9.99 regardless of whether you own a ps3, a ps vita or both. You're getting more than your money's worth with Sound shapes, and every self-respecting platformer fan should own this game. If you own a vita or ps3 do yorself a favour.

And the music is enchanting. But of course, if you just wanted a beautiful game, you might as well just watch a video of it, right? So how is the gameplay?The gameplay is really fun- you play as 3 characters who you can switch between at almost any time, with up to (I believe) 3 players in multiplayer. There is:-Pontius, the knight is a great fighter in close combat, and has a shield which he can use to block enemy projectiles (duh) and glide for a short amount of time.-Amadeus, the wizard (my favorite) can move certain objects (including enemies) and can create boxes around enemies and jump on to get to higher places-the bigger you draw the boxes, the bigger they are-Zoya thief can shoot arrows of different sorts and has a grappling hook that can attach to wooden platforms.The level design and puzzles are really clever and uses each character's strengths and weaknesses, but sometimes there is more than one way to solve a problem, which makes all the characters relevant- it never seems like one character is OP and the others are useless.Of course, as a Wii U game, does it have any cool features? Well, it has Off-TV Play, but the coolest feature is the way that you can use the characters' abilities with the touchscreen- aiming Zoya's arrows and Pontius' shield, and using Amadeus' magical abilities- I think the latter has the coolest touchscreen ability, because it is more comfortable to draw the boxes and move objects around with the touchscreen than with an analog stick. And the story?Well, while there isn't much of one- There is a village, and it is getting attacked by goblins and other evil creatures. There is a magical object called the Trine, which teleports the 3 heroes to different places where evil lurks. Not really very original. But the voice acting is almost perfect- the narrator sounds like the narrator of a fantasy book, the thief is sly but has a kind heart, and she sounds like it. The knight is noble, but a bit dopey, and sounds the slightest bit drunk. The wizard sounds wise. This game is just all around AMAZING.",https://metacritic.com/game/wii-u/trine-2-directors-cut

I will however give the reasons as to why I recommend the Vita version over the 3ds. I own and have played the Vita version and compared it to my friend's 3ds copy. 1- The vita has superior looking graphics. Partly due to the fact the game was designed around the Vita itself, partly due to the superior hardware of the Vita and partly because the Vita version has uncompressed graphics. It looks much nicer on the Vita. The 3ds version has compressed graphics when in comparison don't look nearly as good and if you try to play it in 3d the graphics take a slight dip even further as do all 3ds games. The widescreen aspect of the Vita also helps a lot. The colors are just more vibrant and sharper on the Vita. 2- The sound is better on the Vita. Again it's due to the sound being uncompressed on the Vita while being compressed on the 3ds. It's slight, but noticeable. 3- Game breaking save bug on the 3ds version. The 3ds version of the game in Japan had a bug in it which would destroy your save file and it has carried over into the American game. It's not guaranteed but a lot of people have run into it. If you save your game during certain portions of the game it will corrupt your save and you will have to start all over again. It's been verified by myself and others that the Vita version does not contain this problem. Other notes- The Vita version has trophy support if you're into collecting them. People have claimed the touch screen on the 3ds is far superior but what they don't understand is you can use a style on the Vita and get the exact same results, a simple and very cheap capacitive stylus works just fine on the Vita touch screen. I personally liked having everything on one screen instead of a split screen. You can take screenshots in the game. You get more save game slots while the 3ds has only one. All in all this is a great game and worth playing on either system but at the end of the day I cannot see any reason to not play it on the Vita as it is a better experience in every way.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/zero-escape-virtues-last-reward

This game is a mix of the first Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing game, as well as Mario Kart 7 & Need For Speed. It features all the great fun of a kart racing game, but features beautiful graphics & a more realistic racing game engine that resembles Need For Speed or Forza Motorsport. The controls are very realistic to how how think each vehicle transformation should play. The car sections play just as anyone would expect, the boat sections are great with waves & currents to make the sections funner & more challenging, and the flight sections play like a flight simulator (inverted up & down, etc). For SEGA fans, this game is sure to please you with an incredible roster of beloved Sonic & SEGA characters, as well as tracks that are based off of great levels that they've made into fun tracks to race on. The soundtrack for the game is made of mainly of remixes, but is still perfectly fitting & very catchy.

The closet thing I can think of is the TV series Batman Brave and the Bold. It's got that kind of feel to it, not parody like the 1960s but not dark like the 90s BTAS. Batman has dry humor. He's serious; no one else is. This adds to the entertainment value. COMBAT: Half of the game is breaking stuff. Half of the breaking stuff is combat (fighting Lego people i.e. bad guys). Most action games you have to punch a guy 10 times before they magically disappear; not in Legoland - er, Gotham. You punch a guy maybe 2-3 times and he breaks into pieces (literally ... because they're Legos; no blood). It's simple and fun. The other half of the breaking stuff is breaking random stuff because it's what you do in video games (and needed for puzzle solving). PUZZLES: The other half of the game is puzzles. You'll find yourself stuck a lot of times. After beating everyone in combat, you're not sure what to do next; this is when you have to use your head and think about the environment. It often boils down to this: 1) Are you wearing the right costume (Batman has different gadgets)? If not, change. 2) Have you broken everything you can? Breaking things sometimes reveal pieces you can then use to create something else, like a costumer changer thing or a staircase, which you'll need to get to the second floor or your next stop. Overall, it's a fun experience. You can ride the Batmobile around Gotham City to get to different missions, or you can switch to Robin from Batman (or whichever characters; they are many) and ride a motorbike instead.

Notoriously this is a fans game, much like other sports games, if you`re a fan of the sport, you will love this game and be able to comprehend the technical side of things (Limited as they may be in the game). Theres a definite equalisation between wheel users and controller users, unlike the last game, where anyone with a wheel had an automatic 3 second per lap advantage over controller users. This time, we controller users can really take the fight to them! The graphics are a great improvement over the last version, with the cars and environment looking especially nice. Wet weather has had a BIG improvement, the graphics on track and off the rain heading towards the track is very immersive and wet weather has become very tricky to drive on now. The major changes to the game are important to note as of course they match real life changes in the sport: - No blown diffuser, this is the big change in the game, you will notice a huge difference in traction at low speed corners and mid speed corners without this diffuser. In 2012, you really have to apply the throttle gradually coming out of any hairpins, or even chicanes otherwise because of the reduced downforce given from the BD, you will spin out. This is noticeable in the mid-speed corners too if you try and turn in a little bit too early or correct in the middle of a sweeping corner youll find the car a lot more twitchy on the steering and will risk spinning. Lots more car control required, just what we like! braking bias -  Although i havent tested the braking bias extensively yet, ive had a few stabs at it here and there, you can get through most corners on all tracks without switching your brake bias to the front or rear while out on track, However ive noticed a few lock ups when trying to brake a bit later and gain lap time. So it will definitely aid in eeking out those final tengths. -A.I. Finally the computer are worth racing, theyve really amped up the difficulty on the computer. I know for most of us the computer SUCKED in previous games, it was normal to be faster than the computer by 3 seconds a lap on legend difficulty. Not now though, in multiplayer ive seen legend difficulty destroy some people on the wheels. I myself havent struggled overly with the A.I but they are definitely more competitive, and will hound you especially with the huge DRS boost. In single player they were a lot mor challenging, especially when in a force india, Im not sure if its because i didnt have setups yet, but Paul di resta was beating my ass in qualifying which was a big surprise, Im pretty sure he outqualified me by over a second. Some of that may be down to the lack of a full setup, some the difficulty increase in the A.I All in all a very enjoyable game for a fan especially, the car sounds have been vastly improve, the graphics are good, the racing is fantastic and i love racing the game so far.

To get this you must first change all controll settings to manual though!.. Pes is the best football game for PC gamers if you ask me. Fifa appears on the console very well the paint to come.

The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence. However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear. August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolov’s research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX unit’s modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.

It lots of the characters from sega's past, which is great if you grew up with those games.  If you didn't, it might be harder to relate to the characters but it's a racing game so it shouldn't matter too much. The tracks are very well designed and play extremely well.  There are three parts to this game:  Cart, Airplane, and boat.  The cart plays the best in my opinion, it is completely flawless.  The airplane and boat can sometimes be hard to control but that may just be me. There IS a gamepad only mode.  You just need to swipe down on the gamepad when the game starts up and then you can play it on there.  It was extremely simple to do and I had no problems. The only beef I have with the game is Danicka Patrick, not sure why she is there when they could have had someone like Vectorman in there but to each his own, maybe some people will like her. Overall, I give this game a 10 because it is truly a great game, one that is overlooked and this should not be the case.  This is not a port either because the game was developed equally for xbox 360 and ps3 and even came out the same day.  The game also has a few wii u specific modes that I have yet to try.

The graphics, gameplay and also some features are better than in the PS2-Version. They took some of the gameplay out of Fatal Frame 4: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse (The ghost-hand and the cameraview is behind the charakter from now on for example).Not only this game is one of the best Horrorgames for the Nintendo Wii but one of the best Horrorgames of all times. There is one feature added, which was'nt inside Crimson Butterfly for PS2. The Haunted Houses oder ""Ghosthouses"". This is a bonus added with more gameplay, which is working like a rail-shooter.

As some people have said, the graphics aren't the best. But the graphics aren't that important really. There's no huge polygon counts or extremely high resolution textures. But the game makes up for this with a really good atmosphere. It has very impressive lighting and has really good scenery and land details. There's plants and grass almost everywhere for example, something that you almost never see in realistic amounts in games. The game play itself is the main feature of the game. Those that say it's a bush walking simulator are missing the entire point of the game. You play the role of a man called Richard, a scientist who was researching the cure for a plague. Richard catches said plague and comes to the game's island where a lot of researchers were working on curing it. He arrives to find the scientists missing or dead. And there's a lot of references to some creature stalking everyone. Your role in the game is to find the cure which involves exploring the island and gathering ingredients, all while evading the mysterious creature. Exploring the island by itself is a challenging hazard. With the way the mapping system works (which is easily my favorite part of the game) it's incredibly easy to get lost if you're not paying attention. In addition to that, in your weakened state it's easy to stumble and fall (which can result in you taking damage and sliding down hillsides)  and you can't swim very far because you wear out quickly (which can be somewhat helped later on in the game). Then there's the creature. It has a random chance of appearing in most places plus there's certain times it's guaranteed to appear. You're too weak to harm it and it's faster than you. It has really well written intelligent AI that dynamically reacts to the player's actions (although there's an occasional bug where the creature can get stuck running around in circles although that's not too terribly common and is a bug the developers are addressing), trying to cut off escape. Evading and escaping it is somewhat challenging (very challenging until you learn how to deal with it) and extremely exciting. Graphically, the real impressive parts are the lighting system (which is extremely impressive and realistic) which can stand on even footing with most professionally done development engines and the careful attention to details such as having grass and plants everywhere. For having only two people making the entire game, it's an incredible accomplishment. It's more impressive than many games developed by dozens of people. The game isn't for everyone, just like as any other game. But for those who enjoy exploring beautiful landscapes, solving mysteries, and trying to survive a challenge, this game is one of the best you'll find.

Although Falcom has recently turned to the psp and vita after they lost their PC distributor, they developed almost exclusively PC since the early 80s. The Zelda feeling people are getting should be flipped: the Ys series, which branched off from Dragonslayer, began in 1987. The first LoZ was released in 1986. Dragonslayer began in 1984. The modern day Zelda experience is absolutely nothing like Ys, and serves as a horrible comparison. Ys is traditionally known for its music and difficult boss fights. The composers are from the jdk sound team, which is the remnants of the jdk band from the early 90s. Their primary genre was metal. The boss fights and general gameplay is often cited as using button mashing. Unless you want to die every time, you won't use button mashing. Most boss fights have patterns and tiers, so you can't just inflict massive amounts of damage all at once. Many people also tend to think the gameplay requires grinding. Since levels only affect your base stats, this statement is false. The stages within boss fights do not allow you to do any more than a set amount of damage, so all grinding helps you with is staying alive longer if you get hit a lot. In short, grinding is only necessary if you're bad. A single playthrough on Nightmare takes about 30 hours the first time through. There are 3 playable characters with different stories and boss fights, so a full, 100% completion of the story could take you 70 or 80 hours to complete. There is also a time attack mode for boss fights, which helps to add a bit more replay ability to the game. For $20, this is a great game that everyone should consider trying.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/ys-origin

Now, I admit, my tastes probably fall pretty far out of the mainstream, but I genuinely enjoyed this game immensely.  Combat is old school turn based RPG fare, but this is the best implementation of that style that I have played since Final Fantasy X.  After Final Fantasy XIII, I felt that the idea of an RPG without mazes could never work, but Crimson Shroud totally pulls it off.  You don't direct a character around in a typical fashion; instead, you select any room in the dungeon, and your characters go directly there without random battles, it doesn't matter if it is the room next door or three floors away.  Now, in order to proceed to the next level, you will have to find the room with the trigger, but that is part of the fun.  Several things about the production really grabbed me.  The US translation is top notch.  There is a lot of text in this game.  Every room and item has a detailed description and they are written in a way that really pulled me into the fantasy atmosphere.  I also fell in love with the soundtrack, which definitely has a deep Final Fantasy Tactics lineage.  I have read other reviewers mention short play throughs of Crimson Shroud, but it took me 12 hours to complete my first time, which is a perfect length for a busy guy like me.  Save anywhere also fits well with my lifestyle.  This is the game I have been silently begging for for ages.  This game feels like an evolution of the original NES Final Fantasy, if they had decided to forget about flashy cinematics and focus on telling a story through limited visuals with solid writing.  If the idea of a turn based RPG by the Final Fantasy Tactics team sounds at all interesting to you, I highly recommend you download Crimson Shroud.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/crimson-shroud

Customize your mech (known as trench) and go out into the field to defend the objective. Iron Brigade combines the 3rd person shooter combat with the classic tower defence gameplay of strategically placing turrets of various kinds to help you make a stand. There is a large variety of enemies, which are introduced bit by bit throughout the campaign, ranging from fast fliers to slow yet durable Big Willies, to suicidal Blitzers, and hordes of spiky balls known as the Knobs. Each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses and therefore you are required to outfit your trench with optimum weaponry for each mission in order to be effective. Most of the enemy designs were pretty creative and had a sort of personality. I've played throughout the whole game solo. The early missions are fairly easy, but latter ones do pose a substantial challenge and might require several tries to get your strategy up to perfection. It's fun if you like a challenge. The game also has a handful of boss fights, so to speak. They do feel kind of different and out of touch with the rest of the gameplay though, especially the final boss of the original campaign. There were some small annoyances, like there being too little time in between the waves and cutscenes/dialogue not being skippable (not that I've found anyway), but other than this, it was fine. I didn't realise there was also an expansion act to the game, called 'Rise of the Martian Bear'. After playing the first mission, I'm a bit disappointed with it. It seems co-op play is encouraged much more here than solo play (so I might have to try them out on co-op), not to mention a strange lag that wasn't present in any of the previous missions. You also get some survival missions where you fight an endless horde of enemies. Overall it's a fun game. It has a nice sense of humour to it with a hint of silliness, but it certainly works and can often give you a good chuckle.

The simple graphic aesthetic of sundown with objects simply shown in shadowy outlines turns out to be beautiful, even moreso in 3D. I played NightSky years ago at the IGF when it was set to be a WiiWare game. I was unimpressed at the time. The controls were using tilt, which is simply not precise enough for veteran gamers. You can accomplish SO much more with a proper controller, and when I found out that NightSky was using a controller on the 3DS, I was immediately sold. The game has a great sense of feeling alone, but not in a totally lonely way. You explore and adventure, solving puzzles and using technique to get through it. The sound and music are muted to further provide that sense of isolation. It's a great game to play to get away from things, unique and different from the noisy shooters and other games that are busy trying to get in your face. NightSky lets you come to it and doesn't try to fake you out or sell you. It just is what it is, and what it is, is a lovely game that no-one should miss.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/nightsky

Boy do I wish it was more than that. In my opinion, the entire Levi DLC is masterfully done, and I was on the edge of my seat for some of it. there are some reveals throughout that tie up loose ends from ME 1 and 2, like who was controlling the rachni etc... as far as value goes, its worth the 10 bucks. it even may have some replayability, who knows. What this DLC does wrong, is that it only reinforces to the hardcore fans of Mass Effect that the ending of ME3 was a half-baked disaster. The leviathans should have been the answer to the reapers, along with all the races that you united, not the obscure and left-field catalyst & crucible bull****. It's heartbreaking when Bioware can make content that is beyond excellent, and yet at the same time defend the worst ending in gaming history. It's like Bioware has two heads... ;)  As a DLC itself, if you can put aside that it is yet another middle finger to anyone that dislikes ME3's ending, Leviathan of Dis is the best ME DLC since Lair of the Shadowbroker. aside from the part where you realize its just an increase in Gaylactic Readiness, everything else is well done, well polished, and fun to play. There were even a few times where I forgot I was Playing ME3, and thought It was a ME2 DLC. that in itself is a sign that something was done right. Overall, I Can't justify giving this DLC less than a perfect score. After all, I am rating the DLC, not the full game here. Its just too bad that paid reviewers are now talking about the ending in the review of this DLC, and rating this DLC on the ending of ME3. if they were worth their salt, they would re-rate the actual game itself instead based on the ending, instead of trashing a great DLC.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan

Freshness levels are gone, you can have multiple greenhouses, there's tons of livestock, an area that auto-waters after beating part of the game. Every feature has been streamlined and made less annoying, except for cutscenes. For example, no more clicking two buttons to put a item away, all items are automatically put into the rucksack. Tons of great characters, many of which are completely new. Framerate has been improved dramatically, and if you played Tale of Two Towns on 3DS, then you'll know the pain of bad Harvest Moon framerates. Pacing is good after the first month, many people will complain about the slow pacing, maybe they didn't make it past the first month. To a Harvest Moon veteran, one month will feel like nothing. This game becomes extremely fun as soon as you finish the tutorial. Crops:Crops can be watered twice a day, 10 hours between, this can be mildly annoying until you unlock the auto-water land area. They are about the same as Tale of Two Towns in mechanics, besides the removed freshness rating, crops will last forever in this game! You get your seedmaker pretty early compared to most Harvest Moon games, I got mine within the first year which makes fertilizing crops worth it. Crop festivals are held once a month one the 30th and have three levels of entry, beginning, intermediate and advance - making it possible to participate every single month if you please. Animals:Livestock are a little more simple than Tale of Two Towns, making them less annoying. Petting game has been removed. They have continued the treat system, you get eight different species of livestock and two types of chickens. Your barn and coop can both hold 10 livestock each. Pets have been made more useful early one, they will herd (at least) five animals from your barn or coop with zero hearts (you must assign work to them in game). Pets will continually unlock much like Tale of Two Towns, but now you can sell pets if you please, meaning you aren't stuck with certain styles of pets. Farm:You get three different areas as the game progresses, one implied to be a crop area (auto-water area), and one for animals (flat area) and one for your house and other buildings (first area you get). The auto water area allows you to have 11 4x2 crop spaces that will be watered by moving a boulder everyday. Beehives and mushroom logs are in this game, along with the ""paddy"" crop. Each building, field and other objects can be moved and customized to wherever you please. Town/Wilderness:Your town has two plots of land, one of which is unlocked early in the game and three wilderness areas. You will decide where villager houses go, along with deciding what town decorations will be. Along with town building, you will also be able to unlock certain forest areas, gifts and blueprints with ""Musical Stumps"", which will be introduced to you early on during Spring of Year 1. Almost all villagers are completely new, except for Amir (I think he's in Grand Bazaar) and the Witch Princess. There are many benefits to befriending villagers and wild animals, including free blueprints, gifts and even a certain villager moving in if you befriend his wife, Hana. Love Interest:The bachelors and bachelorettes are equally wonderful and interesting in this game, you are allowed to save slots meaning you can make a boy and girl character if you wish. This game also allows cross dressing (although your character will not change sex), the first time appearing in the Harvest Moon US series along with customization. They've added a feature where you can ""date"" your love interest before proposing to them with a Blue Feather, which is nice because you can also break up with your love interest if you want. Festivals:Each festival you win or participate in will give about 1000 friendship points with every villager, making festivals very much worth participating in. They are pretty easy to win (especially beginner class), meaning you'll enjoy participating in almost every festival (except the Gardening Festival). Cons:The repeated cutscenes. Which happen FOUR times a day if you have pets and Neil/Rod unlocked. There are two unskippable cutscenes that occur and the only way to avoid them is to hide inside a building or run off the map they occur on when they are suppose to happen. It's not a big deal but it does cause your schedule to adjust around it (unless you don't care about the cutscenes. You will most likely be able to beat the game before the end of Year 2, making the game not too dramatically long, but good for most Harvest Moon players. One year will zoom by pretty fast as soon as the tutorial ends for you because the gameplay is so much fun compared to most handheld Harvest Moons.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/harvest-moon-3d-a-new-beginning

Not only that, but it can also use its powers to paste the photos it took back into the environment! Everything that the camera captures is perfectly preserved, and when the photos are restored the objects are restored with it. On top of all of that, this amazing camera can also rotate the photos before they're pasted. Take a picture of an incoming fireball, rotate it and paste it to send it flying into a wall of heavy boxes to knock it out of the way.

Excellent game balance The player can progress through the game at a steady pace.  No constant “run here to pick up drops from dead enemies”, “run there to sell useless items to a merchant”. Occasionally during the game, I worried “I’m not going to make it...I’m not going to make it”.  At that moment, Driftmoon provided some kind of welcome relief. In short, the game’s developer is **very** empathetic towards the player. 2. Puzzles I’m not a big fan of puzzles in RPG games because they break up my “hacking and slashing” rhythm. In Driftmoon, the puzzles are perfect, adding another facet to the game’s pleasant atmosphere. 3. Waypoints As the player explores an area, Driftmoon **automatically** sets waypoints. Then, at moments when, in any other game, the player would think, “I don’t want to trudge through there again”, the player can simply display the local map and click on the desired waypoint to transfer immediately to a previous location. 4. Font Silly, I know, but I really like the font that the developer used for text in Driftmoon.  Moreover—and I’ve never seen it in any other game—the player can adjust the font size via a slider. 5. Feedback Driftmoon’s developer welcomes feedback.  Throughout the game, the player can press the “f” key to display a feedback form.  The completed form is automatically sent to the developer along with, if the player desires, an automatically generated screenshot. Negative Features This review would seem like a marketing pitch (and I do recommend purchasing Driftmoon) if I didn’t include some complaints: 1. Even though the Mod Editor provides tooltips, the Mod Editor is **not** intuitively obvious to the uninitiated.  No documentation exists to explain its functions. 2. The website of the game’s developer, Instant Kingdom, needs a makeover. What do these two complaints have in common?  They show that the game’s developer has focused attention on producing an excellent game rather than on secondary issues.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/driftmoon

The sense of weight and scale is apparent. The combat, once you get the hang of it, is extremely fast based and reactionary. The biggest mechanic that a lot of reviewers seem to be missing is the Dodging / Boosting system.You have to be quick to dodge using your boosters. Read your opponents moves and play strategically while still maintaining twitch reflex shooting. Its very, very intense. Don't treat it like your average FPS, you aren't a humanoid, you are a mech, you have separate advantages and disadvantages, get used to them.  Verticality plays a huge role in the gameplay as well. The mechs are agile in a whole different way. But if you try to run and gun like an average FPS, you're toast. There really isn't any other game like Hawken out right now. Its a Mech Sim FPS with an arcade game feel. There are 8 mechs to choose from, I think, each with their distinct advantages and abilities. The game also features a very robust item/ mech upgrade system, much time will be spend configuring the build that suits you best. As far as the F2P model, its rather well designed, if you play smart and play well, procuring ingame credits is a breeze (as is leveling up). If you lack the patience or time, real world currency can be used for unlocks. Did I mention the game looks incredibly stunning? No other game imo right now touts as much polish and detail visually, its remarkable that its F2P. Get this and decide for your self. A++ PS.

The impressive thing is how responsive it is - I did the Fitness Challenge and so did my wife, but we both got different things to do, and the trainer said he'd seen enough of one drill for me, but not for her - so it really is watching and deciding what you need - and what it needs to work out how good you are, what your balance is like etc.    The assessment at the start is a bit of an intense introduction to the program, it came very close to utterly destroying me, but it gives me confidence that it really knows what's going on.  It really was hardcore, and for a non-exerciser like me, a bit off-putting - but it makes total sense.  If it doesn't push me to my limits then how will it know what I can do?  Off the back of that we got a personalised program - my wife and I chose the same goal, but we both got different drills - so this thing is really adaptive - and for something that almost killed me, surprisingly fun.    The menus are clean and simple, the feedback is generally good and the corrections when I get things a bit wrong are usually spot on - like telling me I'm leading with the wrong leg.  Of course this is Kinect, so not everything is 100% rock solid - but that's what you expect in a Kinect game.  As with most games you spend a lot of time with, the VO can get a little repetitive, but not so it's annoying. The first session is packed with tutorials for each drill, but if you've done it once you don't get it again, so the sessions start to flow better with time.  You do get new drills each session (well, I have so far) so every so often you'll get taught the new moves and it feels varied and it's a nice change of pace when the tuts kick in.    One last point - this is about as far from a game as you can get.  It's not fluff like Wii Fit, or Your Shape.  From what I've seen so far, it's a serious exercise program and I've got no doubt that if I can take it seriously and stick with it (fingers crossed, I'm such a slacker) then I'll see some decent results.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/nike+-kinect-training

Further disappointments are found in the AI, baserunning, and fielding.  Fielding seems ""wonky"" as opposed to smooth and natural and allows outfielders and middle infielders make impressive defensive plays too often, baserunning (at least for me) seems overly complicated, and most importantly the AI fails to make good baseball decisions by holding runners when it shouldnt.

For modern gamers, it's a pain to play. You have 10 goals in each of the 7 levels (an astonishingly small amount of levels, really.) to complete in a 2 minute run. But for those of us who grew up playing THPS2 religiously, this is the game for us. It omits every trick that came after THPS2, and this is the very first game post-Tony Hawk 2 to do that, and it's such a nostalgic, refreshing feeling to get your classic Tony Hawk combos down without the use of reverts, nail-the-trick, spine transfers, etc. Visually, the game looks great. I'm not sure why people are talking about ""abysmal frame rates,"" because frankly, the only time I've noticed frame rate drops are when there are a lot of things going on. I.E., crates exploding in the Hangar level. The game runs smoothly, as far as I'm concerned. Those few and far between frame rate drops are totally forgivable considering the game as a whole runs smoothly, and the levels, pro skaters, textures, and small touches throughout the levels look amazing. The controls couldn't be more spot-on, especially with the Dualshock3. It feels EXACTLY like you're playing THPS2. The D-pad is perfect for this game, since Playstation is where the THPS series got its start. The one and only complaint I have control-wise is that the wallrides are finicky and unreliable. You have to hit them at the seemingly perfect angle to do them. But considering most of the goals in the levels (sans 2 or 3) don't require wallrides, this isn't a huge issue. The audio department is nothing to complain about. Skateboarding sounds like skateboarding. RoboModo took some of the most iconic songs from THPS1 and 2 and incorporated them into THPS HD. It's just too bad they didn't include all of the original songs. Half of the soundtrack is comprised of songs from the first 2 games, and the other half are new additions. Thankfully, these new songs fit well with the game's atmosphere and nostalgic feel. They don't sound like they were last minute additions. When you have an El-P track in your skateboarding game, you know you're doing something right in the sound department. Like I said in the beginning of this review, THPS HD isn't for everyone. If you want to, you can choose one pro skater and blast through the game in around 30 minutes to an hour. But that's not what this game is about. I've completed literally everything there is to do in this game with every character, so I do feel a bit more entitled to review this game more than certain others who pick it up, play it for 15 minutes and label it as a ""this sucks"" experience. The game is about completion. On top of the regular level objectives, you get a mode called PROjectives, which is basically the ""hard mode"" of the original game. And after completing this mode, you'll get the biggest sense of accomplishment considering it's tough as nails. A good, fair challenge for any gamer searching for one. But that seems to be the problem. These first 2 games were released over a decade ago, and it's hard not to say that games have gotten easier over the years. Too much hand holding, too much obvious paths, too much to get you to complete the game as quickly as possible. Not here, I say. If you want to REALLY complete this game, be prepared for one of the toughest gaming experiences you'll find all year. All in all, THPS HD isn't a perfect game. However, it IS a near perfect HD remake. A nostalgic romp through two of gaming's most important titles. The atmosphere, the pro skaters to play as (which look great, by the way), the old way of doing THPS tricks, nearly everything. The one complaint I have is the lack of levels. We're missing classic levels such as Burnside, Philly, and there are no secret levels to unlock, but DLC packs including levels will be available in the near future for purchase. I don't blame THPS HD itself for its mixed reactions, I blame gaming as a whole. Like I mentioned above, if games hadn't gotten easier over time, this game would be revered as one of the greats. Nothing with a major impact, story arc, or anything revolutionary. However, it sure is a lot of fun, and it sure is a good, tough challenge. Something that seems to be missing from any given game released in the past 5 years.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/tony-hawks-pro-skater-hd

I bought this game originally just for collecting and archiving purposes, but instantly fell in love after I gave it a chance.Everything about the game is light hearted and goofy. And that is a great change from the usual pace of realistic dark and grimy shooters we have this days. But it doesn't ruin the combat a bit. The combat in this game is very deep and also fun. If you are a fan of fighting games, you will be able to pull of combos very easily.The dialogue is captivating. I haven't felt inclined to watch cutscenes in years. The characters are cool, interesting and have a lot of depth. I was also very impressed with the voice acting. Not a lot of 3DS games actually have real voice actors, just text to tell the story.On top of all that, this game has infinite replay value. 50 unlockable characters, all with their own stats you can customize to your playstyle, plus tons of unlockable items that do a variety of things.And the multiplayer. I don't know what to say, other than this is the best game to have on the 3DS if you want to play with friends.This is a must have game for any 3DS owner.

The game has two main components: a campaign and a multiplayer setting. In the campaign you fight different opponents to unlock additional cards and various customization items. In multiplayer you confront rivals from around the world. Multiplayer games are less prone to errors if played continuously, that is, without leaving the match to perform other tasks. Being a card-based game, in theory this is possible but in practice you often do not complete your games. There is also an interesting component: you can unlock additional cards if, in your Vita system, you have saves of Uncharted Golden Abyss. While lately the online community mostly vanished - partly also because of the flawed multiplayer server - you can still play matches online if you're lucky. And, in the end, this review aims at stimulating gamers to go and try this awesome game, both offline but especially online.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/uncharted-fight-for-fortune

It also didn't surprise me that this game received a very ordinary score from critics, because the series has a history of rather poor voice acting (with the exception of Holmes & Watson) and being quite poorly animated with quite low frame rates.  These low frame rates also make some NPCs look really ridiculous on screen.  However, the game's strengths are in the story and the puzzles.  Along with The Awakened and Sherlock Holmes Vs Jack The Ripper, this game has a very dark story.  One in which Sherlock Holmes might actually be behind something terrible, and Watson is torn between loyalty and justice.  It's writing and narrative is of a great quality in this sense, and there is great building of tension in it as it progresses.  The puzzles are exactly what you expect from previous titles in the series, as you need to search everywhere for clues and make deductions as to what has taken place.  Some of these puzzles are more difficult than others, and the easy version of this game allows players to simply skip difficult puzzles and enjoy the story.  The music in this game is great, capable of creating the right mood for the scenario.  The gameplay, though chunky, is very workable.  And the graphics, despite the poor animation, are about the same as early PS3 & 360 titles.  The background design is beautifully done with all of the grit and grime of whitechapel and the mill, as well as the lovely victorian design of Baker Street and various other high-end locations that Holmes and Watson visit during their investigation.  If you have kids who are fans of Sherlock Holmes as well as video games, wait until they are at least teenagers before letting them play this game, because it does contain some disturbing imagery.  Overall, an 8.  It is a fun game, but it isn't trying to please the biggest demographic.

However, I'll be honest: I'm not the biggest Ferrari fan. (I root AGAINST them in Formula 1, and I prefer Lamborghinis, Lotuses, and American muscle.) Therefore, I thought for a while before purchasing this game, as it's exclusively focused on putting historic and modern Ferraris through their paces on racing tracks. Plus, I prefer open-world racing games, or at least those that FEEL like open-world (Need for Speed: The Run). Now that I've been playing this game for five days, I am very glad I did decide to get it. The cars are rendered beautifully, which, if you love Ferraris, will mean even more to you than it does to me. And I LOVE the way they handle. When you're driving an old GT car or historic single-seater, they feel exactly as I'd expect them to feel. You're going to have to deal with some bumps throwing the car off balance, and other realistic quirks. As you proceed to modern cars, such as the turbocharged F1-87 Formula 1 car, you'll feel a complete difference. You can absolutely experience the evolution of transmissions, brakes, and suspensions in this game! I'd say that's a big accomplishment. You know how some people call certain sports cars ""driver's cars?"" That's what this game feels like: a driver's game that's a lot of fun if you want not TOO much of a challenge, but not an arcade racer that would bore the simulator folks. As to the missions in the campaign mode, this is an extremely structured, linear game. That being said, I really have enjoyed the missions. You'll do things that just ""feel"" like accurate real-life challenges, such as playing ""follow the leader"" with the Ferrari team's number 1 Grand Prix driver while you're learning.

The small inclusion of touch-screen controls works well to switch free play/super-free play characters and doesn't impede the gameplay (it feels natural).

The Grappler is also a key tool for tactical situations and puzzle solving as players can lift, move, or create cover objects at their whim.

Once again, you'll travel from an island to an island, you'll be collecting things and developing tools to progress further into the game. It's a large grind, but I loved it in this game. You can play as 9 characters in total in the story mode (I believe each of them has unique abilities, for example Brook can run over water, Nami can steal things, Franky can construct bridges, Zoro can cut vines etc.) and you can switch among them freely anytime. You can play as even more characters (including bosses) in the bonus VS mode and if you beat UC1, you can even play as characters from that game. Once again, you can cook food, collect bugs and insects or catch fish in this game and level up your character's attacks and stats.If you are a One Piece fan, the better for you, because you'll get to fight a lot of familiar enemies from the series. However, if you didn't 100% UC1, you will be playing Normal difficulty with upgraded characters, so watch out for that! If you did 100% UC1, prepare for the brutal difficulty of the Unlimited series, not unlike Dark Souls. Overall, a mix of fighting, exploring and item-hunting, basically a Monster Hunter game with One Piece characters.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/one-piece-unlimited-cruise-sp-2

What you may not know is that they are branching into software and publishing, so, low and behold Damage Inc – Pacific Squadron WWII. Damage Inc. is a fighter plane sim with the intention of bringing players a more realistic, dog fighting bunch of goodness. With 20 playable missions spanning various moments in war, starting in WWII Pearl Harbour, you are a rookie straight out of flight school progressing on your military voyage to become a decorated hero of the skies. Its plain a huge amount of time and effort has gone in to bringing real life resemblances to the dozens of planes and upgrades at your disposal. There are great explosions, loop the loops and (kind of) time warps galore. Unfortunately that’s where the good stuff stops. Visual elements in-game are far from that of being realistic, with graphics seeming grainy coupled with dis-proportioned landscapes & surroundings. I found myself enjoying the dogfights at first, but after a short while it felt I was loosing touch with the game and just slipped into auto pilot of shoot plane, bomb ship. Join that with trying to keep your sight on a tiny red dot (that “helps you”) to take down enemy planes, it was a chore at most. Also sprinkle in a big portion of crashes, the game not my piloting skills, bugs and glitches with mission fails and completions occurring, when your not even able to see what is happening but apparently still in control of the aircraft. With two controller set-ups at hand, arcade or simulation (which are unchangeable, unless you start over), trust me neither is stand out, so stick with arcade to save yourself any agony. Ok Ok, I could be shooting down the controls as there is a “special” joystick to tie in with the game, which I haven’t tested myself. But… I hear you say? Research has proven many found it easier with the joy-pad as the AV8R failed to navigate even the basics of the menu… I concur! Now I know this is an early venture for Team MadCatz and lessons will have definitely been learnt along way. Lets just hope & pray, if we do see that any more titles released under their name, they don’t crash and burn like this one. And finally without going into any more detail on how bad the game is, there really isn’t anything I can add. Maybe something other than if you love planes, want to look at them and see them in action. A flight museum or local/ national air show, will be more worthy of your £39.99. My score is based on the original vision that was there initially but never really came to fruition in the final product. At best its a plug and play arcade sim to sit in the drawer or take up needed memory space.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/damage-inc-pacific-squadron-wwii

The bosses in this game are hard as hell as in UA and are a blast to play. It's like Demon Souls in that aspect. I like One Piece but I am not a fanboy, nevertheless, I loved the gameplay. This is the game that I spent the most time playing without interrupting it, really crazy. I can totally understand that some people may find this game boring and tedious, because it's basically a large grind - hunting for items to progress further, but I couldn't help it - I still loved it.It's better than UA for sure. A WARNING, though, the 3DS version is said to be a bad port, so if you can, play the Wii version. Also, unlike the Japanese version which had both Cruise 1 and 2 on a single cartridge, for some dumb reason they decided to split it into two games outside of Japan again and cut 50% of the content. It has an additional Marineford mode over the Wii version which features the whole war and famous battles of that arc, so there's a little extra for you if you want to play the 3DS version.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/one-piece-unlimited-cruise-sp

Perhaps some might be annoyed by the first portion of every level which is literally made like a traditional Game & Watch game. You can see the outline of each possible position of the projectile and the main character Johnny. Your job is to figure out the timing and quickly press the buttons. Johnny Kung Fu has excellent sound and clever use of 3D. I am giving it lower than perfect score because the developers did not attempt to create a story or plot, but just made it like Donkey Kong, where the girl is abducted and the player attempts to save her.Also there are no modes besides the main game mode.
