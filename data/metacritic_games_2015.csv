I am also a HUGE Bethesda fan, playing the Elder Scrolls series since Morrowind. Morrowind and Oblivion are some of my favorite RPGs of all time.  With all that said Fallout 4 has been an incredible game with many interesting and fun elements.  For all of you who don't like to read I'm going to do you a favor and break it down into four points: 1. Gameplay 2. Sound 3. New Features 4. Problems I have with it 1.  The gun gameplay is superb with so many guns and customizations to choose from no two guns feel the same.  Sure the controls aren't as snappy or controllable as Battlefied or COD but that's hardly to be expected from an RPG... VATS is as helpful as always providing a helpful slow down to the madness during combat but now it keeps time going which adds an element of risk to your selection.  Will they move in time to avoid your shot or dodge behind a piece of cover? Lastly because of the viewing distances sniping and long range combat is better than ever before.  I personally like to run a ranged character specializing in sneak, perception, and agility.  To conclude, the gameplay is classic Fallout at its best, refined and tuned to keep up with modern gaming but not too different to loose that frantic Fallout feel. 2.  So many of you have complained about the voice acting for the main characters and that it is a travesty equal to treason and punishable by death.  Why?? When did having a voiced character become a bad thing? I must have been out of town and missed the memo.  Just as many great games  (Dragon Age Inquisition, Mass Effect, BioShock just to name a few) have done in the past Fallout has given a voice to our character.  Maybe some of you don't like it because it takes away from your connection to the character? What ever it is if it really bothers you that much GET OVER IT.  It is not a big deal its just a voice and doesn't take away from the gameplay and if it really bothers you that much you have my permission to plug your ears and hum a tune every time your character talks. Moving on, the music score is classic drawing much of the music that made FO3 great and adding some new classics. 3.  Customization out the wazzoo, Settlements, Facial sculpting, power armor customization, customization of weapons, customization, customization oh yeah and customization.  There are so many things in this game that you can change and make your own! This leads to many different possibilities for dramatically different play throughs. Something to me that makes Bethesda RPGs so great are the many different customizations of character, weapons, skills, armor, and even story and FO4 delivers this over and over.  Another new feature to add to this list are good graphics. I know that some of you will think ""Wahh good graphics aren't a new feature wahhh"" and I will respond by saying um yes they are.  Maybe many of you forgot or just have issues with memory but FO3's graphics SUCK!! Seriously go back and try playing now you will be amazed at how poorly the graphics look.  Want to know why? Because it is a massive game! you cant expect a game that huge to have photorealistic graphics (at least not yet). Here is a revelation that will amazing you... FO4 does have good graphics! Sure its not going to win any awards for its graphics but its on par with every other massive game Bethesda has come out with.  So until all you people who whine about graphics get a masters degree in game/graphic design, can it. 4. Lastly here are my problems: it wen the route of Skyrim.  Bethesda has done this thing recently where it is trying to appeal to you silly casual gamers (what ever that is) and has dumbed down their game.  Personally I thought Skyrim was only decent and lacked a TON of cool, albeit, more complicated features oblivion did (off the top of my head spell creation).  Bethesda has done it again with FO4 where they have taken out some of the features that will in the long run make each of the characters you create more unique and lost some of its depth in gameplay.  An example of this is the fact that now all you have for skills is the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system instead of each skill being leveled up with use.  This makes it so that you don't have to learn to use skills before you put points into them and makes your character feel over powered right off the start.  Secondly I wish they hadn't made power armor so abundant and so accessible right away... Power armor should be something you work to and establishes you as a king/queen of the wasteland later in the game. To recap this lengthy review (thanks to those who actually read this even though I doubt it was many).  FO4 is an INCREDIBLE game that is only going to improve over time with updates and DLC. Give it a chance, stop being a cry baby, and actually try playing it through and you might realize that you have a piece of gaming history.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/fallout-4

You actually get access to a map of people you talked to, and upon discovering connection between them they get connected on the grid with specific relation. You can change/enhance that relations by doing different quests, and those sometimes offer you a choice. Upon doing quests more and more of them are coming.

The game from the beginning has a very noticeable Metroid meets Contra in the belly of Red Falcon sort of feel and I have to say that I love it. One thing right off the bat that this game gets right is the basic controls. Firing your weapon in all directions felt just as smooth as an NES or SNES side scrollers without that weightiness present in most games. Jumping and firing on enemies with the sound effects and enemy explosions felt satisfying. A very easy game to pick up and immediately start playing. The story is best described as a complex science fiction tale where a scientist named Trace supposedly dies in a lab explosion only to awaken unharmed in an alien world. Armed with a biomechanical gun and tasked by a female voice in his mind, Trace runs out into this mysterious world searching for answers while trying not get killed in the process. The game is filled with weapons, health and weapons upgrades, unique enemies, boss battles and of course secret areas. Each world is interconnected by portals or breaches in structures where you must fight enemies and find that specific upgrade to continue on. One of my favorite upgrades might have to be the mechanical drone. This little laser armed critter can get to hard to reach areas or tunnels all the while Trace is protected under a barrier shield. A very useful way to clear the path of enemies in tight situations. A later upgrade even allows you to increase the launch distance of the drone as well as allow you to teleport to its location making traversing areas quicker. The laser drill attachment also acquired near the begin is also a beautiful tool for passing through rocky areas and enemies. The music feels like a love letter to the chiptune styles of the NES and SNES and do I love the design choice.  The constant loop does bring back nostalgic feelings, however, I feel the sound was spot on for the atmosphere and style of the game. Of course, what appears to be pretty straight forward good vs evil side scrolling shooter evolves into an existential drama of dark events and discovery of who you really are – as well as the motives of your enemy and allies.  It is certainly complex and will get you pondering afterwards – however, there are quite a few hidden documents and notes that you can uncover and translate to find out what has been transpiring. I will not lie that some of it can be confusing, however, its complexity and winding nature kept me piqued. Whether a gamer loves it or hates it will be one’s story telling preferences methinks. If there were any issues, I would say that the dashing teleporting mechanic which later serves as a quick dash to break through walls or access alternate paths or double jump can be a little hard to master when trying to access overhead areas. I found it was best used in tandem with a grappling hook accessory.  In addition, the weapon wheel used to select your full arsenal in game vs. during a pause can be a little difficult to direct especially as you gain more weapons  – however, none of these were deal breakers. Also, anyone looking for someone to hold your hand, this is most likely not the game for you. Although you get save points in each map, there is no regenerative health (you have to earn it) and only one life.  There are no glowing indicators telling you exactly where to go (although colors exist on the map for potentially red boss rooms, light blue save rooms, or areas of importance) and you cannot teleport between worlds. You have to trek it out on foot or with your upgrades.  However, there are some hidden drops and one fast mode of travel in a specific area if a gamer discovers it. In addition, sometimes you will get trapped in a world with no option other than to go deeper into it. To me, it is my favorite environmental choice – forcing you to explore the rich environments, only to find another powerup to access other areas as well as allow you to finally backtrack to the previous worlds. As for the supposed “glitches” that appear on screen (another throwback to the NES days), these are actually intentional. A later upgrade called the Address Disruptor allows you to manipulate not only these glitchy environments to open up new areas but also change the attack patterns and forms of your enemies - sometimes even allowing them to spawn energy to refill your health. All of this (the game, soundtrack and story) developed by one man over a span of 5 years is astonishing in my opinion and shows how an indie game or any game can be done well with a great attention to detail and love for the genre. I only think what Tom Happ could do with a large team and bigger budget. If you have a PS4, I think it is a no brainer to get it, just be aware of what you are getting into.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/axiom-verge

Но всё же, по факту это идея и сеттинг Диг Дага , только не тупая аркада японская, а довольно таки интересное произведение. Мы стимботы на Диком Западе, и копаем шахту. Ищем руду, руду доставляем в город (хаб), и обмениваем её не даньги. За деньги улучшаем нашего персонажа, и покупаем расходники, коих немного, и по факту они не нужны, но они тут зачем-то есть. В общем и целом, игра выглядит красиво и сочно, геймплей затягивает, как и ожидается от подобных игр - мы копаем глубже и глубже, совершенствуя себя и всё лучше и лучше преодолеваем всё новые и новые препятствие. Есть враги, но они тупы и слабо-опасны, есть один босс, финальный, но он скорее основан на взаимодествии с окружением, как и большая часть челенджа тут. Тут очень много загадок со взаимодействием с окружением, что круто.

Пополнять их можно с врагов, ресурсы падают все три, но беда в том...что дроп НЕ ДИНАМИЧЕСКИЙ. Вы можете быть почти в темноте  и здоровье на нуле, а из врагов падает только ВОДА, КОТОРОЙ У ВАС ПОЛНЫЙ БАК. Это не критично, но будет вас раздражать немножко на протяжении более чем половины игры.

35,Shadowrun: Hong Kong,pc,"Aug 20, 2015",,81,7.8,Harebrained Schemes LLC,Harebrained Schemes LLC,"['Role-Playing', ',                                            ', 'Western-Style', ' ']",No Online Multiplayer,,"The third iteration of the Shadowrun series of group-based cRPGs. These games are fairly light on gameplay and more narrative focused than most cRPGs. By that I mean there is an extensive amount of well-written dialogue (however, a few spelling issues/typos) and combat doesn't happen too frequently. However, the amount of combat somewhat depends on player choice of skills, how they approach a situation, and which team members they bring to the missions. There are cases where you can go through missions with minimal or no combat which is a big change from the previous games. You team selection is fairly well-rounded and good for both combat and non-combat situations.  Bringing different team members usually provides you with different ways of approaching a problem. I found on my second playthrough that the missions played a bit differently based on my skills, who I brought and choices I made. I think that it adds to the replay value so it's worth playing through a second time just to see what you've missed. The missions are really well designed and have multiple ways to traverse them or find extras within the levels. As far as the story/writing, well the entire game is just absolutely loaded with dialogue, text-descriptions, menu based choices, and interaction with companions and various NPCs. If you're looking for more of an action-based game, this isn't it. If you spend your time reading through all of the dialogue and doing all of the missions available, it'll likely take you around 20 hours to beat. If you just try to beat the game as quick as possible and ignore the dialogue, it'll likely take you under 10 hours. One of the key selling points of the game is reading through the texts and finding more about the world, it's characters, and the story. One nagging downside is the story tends to halt for a bit if you're looking to do every mission. You'll have talked to everyone, have the final missions unlocked, and still have three or four optional missions left. The combat plays out well and a lot quicker paced than the previous two games with smaller bite sized battles and partially due to the fact that the AI responds faster and animations are quicker. In addition, you're able to enter battle mode if you see an encounter so you're tactically in a better place before the battle starts and you'll leave battle mode after encounters.  This is a change from the previous games where it would just have entire maps full of battles. There is more of everything as far as combat options; Adepts/mages/shamans all have a few new spells and totems, there are more melee/cyberware/gun/drug/health options than before, etc. Dragonlines are one of the bigger new additions to magic. They allow mages to have their spells bounce off of nearby targets(or allies if they're in the area), allow damaging spells to heal you or simple reduce cooldown/increase effectively like the old leylines. The particular effect isnt posted so its try and see. Armor has been radically simplified in that it no longer provides bonuses but straight armor class and there are unique options from the vendors around town (mage/shaman, adept, street sam, and decker). It's purely cosmetic but helps your character look the part. The matrix has been completely overhauled from the previous games. Almost all of the matrix nodes will just have White IC (intrusion countermeasures) scour areas with set paths and vision cones. As long as you avoid them, you avoid matrix combat. However, if you blunder into them or just don't care to work around timing puzzles, you can just enter into combat with them and it's a bit more challenging but certainly doable. There is a mini-game associated with hacking firewalls to get access to datastores or matrix controls and it's fairly easy to accomplish. Those can also be destroyed brute force via combat if you're in an alert state. The aesthetics of the game have been improved from the previous two games. The colorful art style and backgrounds are still there but now there is more variety in PC/NPCs and most of the character models/animations have been redone. No more massive body trolls with stick legs. The spells have nice new effects, there is more blood and gore, and all of the weapons/spells/punches/abilities feel more impactful. The music is very atmospheric but non-descript. I found that I don't seem to remember any particular track from the game but found that it just subtly added to the mood/atmosphere. All in all, I loved the game and have played through it twice and assume I will play it again! I think it's a good sign when the game ends that you roll up a new character and start another game. The drawbacks I have for the game are mostly subjective, there are a few minor bugs/typos which will hopefully get fixed soon.

Going off of telltale I have not experienced any immersion breaking graphical glitches (unlike telltale games where you will have body parts/ weapons fading through clothing etc) and the game tries to keep it so that the information you need to remember is provided within each episode (with one exception), which is handy since the business model has the episodes coming out every 2 or so months. The time travel mechanics are also very fresh (and thus unclear) and makes me wonder at the possibilities for time travel in future games. The bad: Some have pointed out issues with lip syncing but I have not noticed, also there is one exception to what I previously stated in that you do need to remember how the time travel mechanics work (which isn't very clear in the first place) from previous episodes, for example there were two puzzles in episode 3 which had me stumped for a good 10-15 minutes each, the first puzzle relies on using time travel mechanics in an unconventional way that you may or may not figure out as the game doesn't tell you (or if it does I don't remember it telling me which is a fault in clarity and guiding the player as several others have experienced this problem). The second puzzle I can't really get into without spoiling, but it was a failure in terms of game design, but not one that relies on the time travel mechanics. The ugly: Now for the business model, I abhor this business model (the episodic business model) and is one of the oldest tricks in the book in terms of television, it makes you want the next episode encourages you constantly thinking about it throughout the weekly, month;y or yearly, release schedule. This is a common marketing ploy used to keep you thinking about a product and is very effective in making you want more. However I am still willing to give this game a 10, which I suppose speaks to its effectiveness. TL:DNR Great game, while not a ""game changer"", like games such as Telltales the Walking Dead, it is still one of the finest examples of the genre and of storytelling in video games.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/life-is-strange-episode-3---chaos-theory

However, the real joy of Helldivers is trying out every weapon, every stratagem, and making them work. The developers have released generous DLC in the form of new equipment. These are all worth the purchase, but there is no pay-to-win, here. All missions are beatable with the stock weapons and stratagems, but the DLC is there for those that love the game and want more. Helldivers is almost certainly the best co-op title available on PS4, and there is an argument to be made that it is the best game, period, on the system.

It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition. Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability.

Because of that, a nice feeling of tension is added to the story, as you have to walk around in the darkness using only the light of your mobile phone. It is quite reminiscent of some horror games and a welcome addition overall.- Also, it feels more like an adventure game, as there are more parts this time around where you have to gather items. There is more interaction with people and the surroundings this time around.- The ending part is simply amazing and a great idea overall. I love the direction this series is going and I no longer have doubts that this series will be long remembered as the first one that tried to attempt something slightly different and managed to do it in such a great way.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-3---chaos-theory

Fast forward to today and having played through around 5 hours of Apotheon, I have to say the game has impressed me very much so far. I absolutely love the visuals and little details within the game, which is heavily based on the art seen on ancient Greek pottery, conveying a dream-like feel as you wander the various areas within the game. The color scheme used for each area is very interesting, often going for a monochromatic look for many (if not all, as I have not completed the game as of yet) areas of the world, which gives the game a very nice and consistent look, yet each area within the game still feels distinct. The character and creature renderings are very well done and highly stylized, and while I myself love it, it may not appeal to those who like a less stylized feel. That being said, I feel that the rendering of the animals, humans, creatures, and gods are spot on and doesn’t go overboard with excessive details (understandable given the style of ancient Greek art) giving everything a nice and streamlined look, while maintaining the little flourishes here and there where it counts (like the lines that adorn the body of elk/deer/hind/whatever they’re called). The combat system is actually pretty simplified, yet interesting, with different types of swings/thrusts being at your disposal (depending on the position of the mouse), with much of combat being about timing, movement, and matching up weapons that are better suited to the current fight to give you the most advantage. The world of Apotheon is a destructible one, so don’t get too attached to your weapons or shields as they will eventually wear down and break.. This rule also extends to the objects that inhabit the game world, with many being able to be destroyed with possible spoils to be looted. The game is surprisingly visceral as well, which I didn’t really expect, showing spurts of blood when you strike a creature/person, while a mortally wounded enemy will cough and choke and gurgle as they lay dying. Musically, the score is beautiful, although it does hit the wailing woman trope a lot and it knows when to add an exclamation point to a scene and when to linger in the background, adding more wonder/tension to exploration and combat, respectively. All this is well and good, but probably the thing I love the most about Apotheon is the lack of constraint in the way you approach the game, which is more of a sandbox than anything else. Of course its not completely open world like Oblivion or Skyrim, but its open enough to allow me to explore the world at my leisure and really communicates the feel (or illusion) of freedom very well as you wander about, as well as a sense of wonder as you uncover new areas or secrets. Within this open world, animals wander and flee from you, citizens go about their (although limited) business, while friends and enemies populate the wilds and are always spawning, giving the game a sometimes frantic pace. In this, resource management is key, as is keeping a nice healthy stock of weapons and supplies. It’s not a perfect game, make no mistake in that, as it does have some issues with the controls (at least getting used to using the mouse to aim) that take some time to get acclimated to. Difficulty seems to be above average (or I could be wandering around where I shouldn’t be…) and it does feel like I’m fighting for my life sometimes, which keeps the pressure on and provides a healthy amount of tension. I have to say I am biased about Apotheon, in the sense that it is a game that happens to have the features I most appreciate in a game, any game, but I also feel that it is a strong title overall, but is probably not for everyone. If you love Greek mythology and history, or if you’re a fan of open world action/platformers/rpgs that don’t really hold your hand, you’ll love this game. I had some very cautious expectations of this title before release and have not been disappointed yet.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/apotheon

No rhyme or reason to the skillshot, rule set seems complicated, and the setup of the table is weak. Aforementioned skillshot is more luck than skill, Archer's car placed near the front of the play field largely gets in the way. Only 1 upper playfield flipper adds little, mini games are dull. The other 1 I had so much hope for, Bob's Burgers, was less of a letdown but still not great. Playfield is mostly ramps, again skill shot makes no sense, mini games mostly involve spamming ramp shots. 1 upper playfield flipper I have still never gotten to use in about 20 plays. Family Guy was a pleasant surprise- right from start with skill shot and Joe Swanson plunger. Varied play field creates good mix of ramps and targets to aim for. Mini games like ""Peter vs. the Chicken"" are fun and the right level of difficult. Enjoy the special balls for the game's characters- nice mix up of characters using the major (Griffins, Quagmire) and minor ones (Herbert, Mayor West) alike. The best table, perhaps surprisingly due to it probably being the least popular show, was American Dad. Creative use of all the characters with mini games and targets (such as Klaus' fishbowl) and running bits from the show, such as ""Wheels and the Legman"" and Steve and Snot's air guitar. Most varied play field of the 4, mostly enjoyable multiball action as well. Only knock is that the character's comments get a tad repetitive. Table ratings: Archer 5.5/10Bob's Burgers 7/10Family Guy 9.5/10American Dad 9.5/10",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/zen-pinball-2-balls-of-glory

The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institutions current Art of the Computer Game exhibition. Wasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.

It revolves around a woman who is having a phone conservation with their family while driving home during a tornado warning. You have to use the arrow key to drive and the conservation stops when you stop driving so you have to keep moving as well as choosing responses. You start to get a sense of why she was out wondering around old family property and what issues the family is going through. The dialogue is some of the best I have seen in a visual novel and the background story is well done. The atmosphere of rain and tornado sirens going off while driving really set a good mood. The soundtrack over the credits was also well matched. There were some dialogue choices that were in brackets and I couldn’t tell if they were supposed to be an inner monologue; sarcasm; or something else. They still got a response from whoever I was talking to so I don’t think inner monologue fit but the responses were always hostile or prompted a negative response. It didn’t seem to fit with the other parts of the conservation. There is an epilogue to play when done with the main game but it wasn’t as well done as the main game. It sheds light on some of the main characters life issues but just failed to hold my interest as much. The text was pretty hard to read at first but luckily I noticed that there was an option to switch to a more bold font which solved that issue for me. I played Three Fourths Home on Linux. It never crashed on me. It uses the Unity engine. There is one graphics setting as well as an AA toggle. The games used up 2334MB of disk space. I didn’t notice any spelling errors. There is a manual save option you can use at any time but there is only one save slot so you will overwrite the save each time. Alt-Tab didn’t work. VRAM Used: 802-971MBCPU Usage: 1-4%RAM Usage: 2.8-2.9GB Overall I would recommend the game to fans of visual novels. It tries to set itself apart in terms of content and game play and succeeds. It’s warts are minor and didn’t hurt the experience. I paid $2.33 CAD for the game and it was well worth it for that. The full price of $5.49 CAD is also a decent fit for it although that’s about the maximum I would pay. I finished the main game and epilogue in 58 minutes. My Score: 7/10 My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 5700 XT 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 19.3.5 | Samsung 850 Evo 250GB | Manjaro 19.0.2 | Mate 1.24 | Kernel 5.5.13-1-MANJARO",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/three-fourths-home

The final boss in particular is an utter joke whose entire difficulty comes from the fact that he just doesn't take damage at times. What times? Who's to say! The developers certainly didn't make it clear, and eventually I gave up after ten times of having to read the same dumbass twist that reveals itself before the final encounter. Maybe try this game if you get it for free in a bundle or something but do not spend any amount of money on it.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/luckslinger

You control Rex, a tyrannosaur astronaut whose job it is to save Earth from an incoming asteroid. The gameplay consists of navigating your way through a number of 2D levels – 40 to be exact – plus four boss stages. The core gameplay is fairly simple – the central premise is that you have a pair of rocket boots, meaning you can jump an infinite amount of times in the air, boost yourself straight up at a high rate, boost yourself sideways at a high rate (which launches a mid-range projectile in the opposite direction), or do a butt stomp to deal damage to something below you. You also have a bicycle kick which deals damage in all directions around you. There are a number of enemies. Some of them can be killed with some of your attacks, while others can be temporarily stunned. More interestingly, most projectiles can also be destroyed by your attacks, allowing you to defend yourself from them. The bosses all have large numbers of hit points; three of them are fairly standard “large hit point gauge” bosses, though each of them has a way to be killed much more quickly. The final boss has two phases, and the first phase regenerates, making it easily the hardest boss in the game. The primary goal is of the game is the three stars you get for completing each stage; you need a certain number of stars to unlock more stages, and getting the “proper” ending requires you to get almost all of the stars in the game. One star is awarded automatically for completing each stage; this is generally not a terribly difficult task, as there are checkpoints in the levels and most of the stages are pretty generous with them. A second star is awarded for completing a stage without dying, and a third star is awarded for completing a stage within a certain time limit. You don’t need to accomplish both optional tasks in one run to get all three stars, but on many of the stages, the time limits are tight enough that you cannot afford to die, or can only die once, to get the time. Because the stages are persistent after your death, there are times when dying and respawning closer to where you need to go can cut down on the time needed to beat a level, and a few levels require you to do so. There are optional bonus levels and collectibles in almost every stage which unlock cosmetic improvements to Rex’s home base. In addition, each stage contains a large number of coins and gems which can be collected in order to purchase cosmetic items; collecting all the coins gives a coin bonus, and eventually, an achievement for doing it in every stage. Only the very final stage in the game does not have checkpoints, and it is a borderline platform hell level, making it pretty annoying. Overall, the game is pretty tough as far as such games go; it took me about 7 hours and 40 minutes to 100% the game according to the in-game timer. It is nowhere near the difficulty level of, say, a game like Super Meat Boy, but it is still fairly tough. The real challenge mostly lies in the speed runs, though in a few levels, not dying is the more difficult challenge. By and large, the levels are decent enough, but it is hard to shake the feeling that, for the first 3/4ths of the game, there isn’t much to denote your progress. The stages get gradually harder, but only the final nine stages really feel all that different from what came before. The game never gets too difficult (save for the final, checkpointless stage which is a borderline platform hell level, which is a bit frustrating) but apart from the final area there is little sense of progression. The game mechanics and level designs are decent enough, but the stages aren’t terribly pretty and are pretty bare-bones functional, as is typical in such retro games. In the end, I can’t really recommend this game, but not because it is bad. It is not bad. It is decent enough and I didn’t feel bored while playing it. What the game suffers from is being mediocre. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it is pretty much exactly enjoyable enough to keep the player from getting bored, never so good that you get actively excited about it. You just aren’t missing anything by never playing this game. And if you aren’t missing anything by playing a game, why give up eight hours of your life to do so?",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/jumpjet-rex

There is a soldier called Stash. Private Stash. He manages your... private... stash. So yeah, lots of dadjokes. If you like that sort of thing, you'll have a great time. The story could've had a bit more to it, but I suppose the money runs out quickly when you hire Geralt of Rivia to voice the main character :) It still has its moments, but this is more of a gameplay-driven experience. I've spent 10 hours on the game so far, and I plan to 100% complete it.

When games are made on tighter budgets we tend to only expect them to look so good or play so smoothly.  With Oceanhorn we have a beautiful 3D world with excellent gameplay inspired straight from the best Zelda games.  Clever puzzles, wonderful dungeons, and a grand sense of exploration put this game right on par with the triple-A games that influence it.  That may be hard to believe but I'll try to convince you in detail... or better yet just go check it. Honestly, I never grew up playing too many of the Zelda games.  That being said the protagonist, running around with his sword and shield, fits right into Link's archetype.  Oceanhorn, not only in looks but in gameplay, fits right in with the likes of Wind Waker or Link to the Past.  You progress from one island (dungeon) to the next gaining new abilities and weapons that will allow you to access to more and more areas.  These classic weapons include bombs and a bow as well as magic, such as the ability to summon fire and ice.  You can even find heart containers, four of which will increase your maximum health. As you explore these islands you'll have numerous puzzles to solve and enemies to slice down, including bosses.  The level design is phenomenal, prompting exploration and keeping you excited to see whats next.  The puzzles never get too challenging but many of them will make you stop and think.  The enemies aren't too challenging either but between them and the traps you can find yourself low on health pretty quickly.  The bosses mix things up a bit, usually requiring a particular sequence of events to inflict damage.  This game isn't supposed to be difficult, its designed so that gamers of all ages and skill levels can explore a big world and go on an exciting adventure. Oceanhorn has a solid story but its just not particularly exciting.  That is not to say that the story takes away from what is otherwise a superb experience, it still helps give you a sense of purpose.  You wake up to find your father has left you because of the threat poised by Oceanhorn.  Oceanhorn is a monster consider to be a living fortress, a machine with a soul, that haunts the world around you.  As you start to explore you'll hear your father reminisce, via your journal, commenting on the history of each island.  On occasion there are other little cut-scenes with different characters to emphasize the importance of your journey or give you a brief history lesson.  Besides the stuff with your father much of it is forgettable but it all helps to ground the game and make the world believable. Clocking in at a solid 10 hours there certainly isn't much to complain about.  Sure the story is a little cliche but thats not why you'll be playing Oceanhorn.   This game is all about going on a grand adventure, finding new abilities and items that give you a wonderful sense of progression.  Never knowing whats around the corner or in the next room will keep you absorbed throughout your entire journey.

Fear not,   gamers, for Action Henk is one of the best games I've played yet. It's perfect for the perfectionists who will not stop until they get the best time they possibly can, and makes a wonderful party game to play with friends. The controls of this game can be summed up as a run button, a jump button, a slide button, and a ""hook"" button for certain levels. As simple as these controls may be, they play smoothly and enjoyably, and are fine-tuned in such a way that even a millisecond delay in pressing a button can greatly impact your run. I will warn you, however, that this game is a challenge; sure, you could easily pass most of the levels, but achieving all the medals takes 100% of your concentration. And if going for the gold isn't enough for you, you can reach for the rainbow medals. which can only be obtained by the community's most elite. The graphics are the perfect blend of quality and aesthetics, and the game almost always performs at a lovely 60 FPS. The art style reminds me a lot of Toy Story (though some of the figurines look absolutely horrifying), and the environments welcome players (or frighten them, as the game gets more difficult). Even if a difficult speedrunner isn't the game for you, you should still consider buying the soundtrack. The music is high-speed and energetic, and is always a pleasure to. Overall, Action Henk is one of those gems that might not be that popular, but are still worth the buy. I am absolutely certain that Ragesquid has a future in the gaming industry.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/action-henk

It attempts to make the case for $20 on presentation because it definitely doesn’t have many features.  Hope you like standard Texas Hold’em because that is only thing to be played here.  Your options are to play in tournaments that require waiting around for enough players, open tables of an unbalanced drop in and out, and AI play of playing standard video game stereotypes of imaginary people. Pure Hold’em is by the same makers of Pure Pool so it exists in a world where objects move around with any humans.  Just like Pure Pool the presentation and visuals are top notch and it might be the most beautiful poker game ever made.  In game music is a diverse selection but after hours of playing you are going to turn it off and listen to Spotify. The AI is terrible and will slow play you to boredom.  Do not buy to play single player. Gameplay and controls are smooth and intuitive and the pace of play remains as fast as possible.  There is no way for other players to communicate without always horrible sounding voice chat.  A few quick text commands would have be a welcome addition.  There were too many different levels of tables to play with no browser that worries me that it may be hard to get in a game in the future. My biggest issue with the game is the currency system.  It is confusing on how the fake money is obtained and how much is lost per game with no explanation given.  There is no pay-to-play hounding you to pay real money for more currency and I never ran out of money. It is a necessary evil to have a currency system to prevent users from going all-in on first hands and popping between games quickly and it does the job here. I am having a lot of fun with Pure Hold’em and it plays a great game that keeps me occupied for hours.  It is hard to be revolutionary with Texas Hold’em game.  The best thing a poker videogame can do is keep up the pace of the game and be visually pleasing and Pure Hold’em accomplishes that task.  It is the best poker game I have ever played but a premium experience for $20, that could be played for free on a phone, is a value proposition for you to decide.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/pure-hold-em

I enjoyed it, although I wish there was the possibility to select five different types of thieves who have different abilities than the others. The only big negative aspect is that there are serious bugs with the controls sometimes which is one of the reasons why I have given up to do a perfect run, since it's basically a gamble.Bugs include: invisible spikes, jumping often doesn't work if you're on sloping ground or on steps, characters uncontrollably sinking when standing on a ledge, character freezes sometimes after hacking a door etc It's little stuff that could be fixed with a patch but can get really annoying the more you become a pro.Another obstacle can be the visual style, although it's beautifully drawn, there are several occasions when the screen is just too busy that you overlook little enemies that can give you an insta-kill. The reason for that is that a lot of stuff is going on, on the screen. Even in the background, and the colors  of some enemies are very similar to the BG and they blend in sometimes. I don't know if that was intended to make the game more difficult, but it could be fun if there is an 'easy version' where the visuals are slightly more cut'n dry, for beginners. I recommended it to several friends, but it's a bit  hard to get into in the beginning, those who did persisted loved it in the end.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-swindle

Heroes of Might and Magic III was one of the first games I played and really liked. It was a turn based game with a big map where you have to search for monsters and treasures on a fantasy setting. Since that moment I played that game it's my favorite genre.20 years later many games tried to be successful in the genre. The disciples series for example and the Age of Wonders series managed to make a wonderful collection of games.I think I can name another 200 turn based strategy games I played afterwards and many of them did a really good job to copy many parts of those games mentioned and with different succes.What confuse me now is that everytime a new game release in the genre it have better graphics but the game mechanism is almost the same every time. It's like most devs are afraid to take a different path and try something new. So for me the genre is stale now and streamlining, tablet games and dumbed down versions of many games released now doesn't make this any better.So here start my review of Thea: The Awakening. While developed by a small 4 member dev team they managed to be original in almost every part of the genre and without any compromise. What you get here is a fully rendered random adventure map every time you play. With random resources, random monster lairs and loads of other adventure objects. You can customize the difficulty of how you want to play completely. Like the size of the map, the strength of the encounters and even if you want to play in iron mode you can if you want. You are a god and all gods in the game have a different skillset which unlocks while playing the game. You start with only two gods and when gathering XP you unlock more on the run. The god isn't controlled directly but give direction to your small village somewhere on the map. This village is your main base. From here you start to send expeditions out in the world to gather for resources and to unfold the many, excellent written, storylines in the game. Those resources you use for feed your people and fuel your crafting system. There are 4400 items in game now and the devs plan to extend this number with free only DLC.With those resources you can almost craft an infinite number of items like weapons, but also crafting tools and gathering tools. You can even find other creatures to support you in your quest to victory.Your task is to keep your villagers alive, equip them with the many items you find or craft, explore and survive the region. Difference between characters is not only because of gear, but because of a comprehensive skill list as well. More depth then many RPG games you find here while building your characters. Those skills comes in handy when you encounter the numerous quest stories on the map and in your home town.When an encounter happens the game change is what the devs call a mini card game, but believe me they are way to modest. This card game have depth, is complex but easy to understand. It looks simple at first, but because the different skills, weapon combinations every fight turns out in a different card game you can easily compare with the big names in the industry. You have a card draw, a reshuffle option and you have to play it out very tactical to survive with two random elements. The stats of the monsters are different every time and the initiative of the characters as well.If you want your characters not get involved in a fight most of the time you have another option to play the card game a different way. Like a sneak challenge or a tactic challenge. The difference is the loot is less but it prevent your characters from getting wounded.I have 23 hours in the game in 3 days and I'm still hooked to it. It's a fresh new welcome addition to the genre and I expect some big AAA companies are following this title closely at the moment.As I said the small dev team, non native English speakers managed to make modern and fresh fantasy storylines within a Slavic Mythology setting. The artwork is really beautiful. The interface is clean, all 4400 items in game have a different clean picture, the map is a hex based 3D landscape with 3D character models all DX11 proof. The card game is more old style like an original paper fantasy card game. The stories are all illustrated with beautiful paintings. Another thing I recognize is that in every different type of challenge or fight the background and sound effects change to the situation you are in. I see many games from tripe A companies that don't manage this very well and this is perfect for ambience and really makes you love this game. I rate this 10/10 without doubt and advice you to read some reviews of the game on the better non commercial gaming sites like Spacesector or eXplorminate. And excuse for my bad English for this long read I'm from Holland myself.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/thea-the-awakening

I played all of them, and this one is different for sure. It gets rid of a lot of mechanics that were cumbersome, and puts its focus on build up part. It is strongly designed for the singe player aspect and has no real multiplayer components, but if you like to play at your own pace multiplayer is nothing that works out pretty well in these kind of games anyway. Thus I am not really missing it. In terms of atmosphere and game-feel I really got into the mood of establishing a mega corps, that runs colonies and cities. It is a game where you need to immerse yourself, checking statistics, checking data and numbers, optimizing and re-planning your industry parks to really get most out of it.Do not make the mistake and approach it like a Sim City game. It really is something unique in terms of game-play blend. For me the motivation comes from slipping into the role of a CEO that is leading a mega-corp, and feeling empowered to create a mega empire. The multi session game-play takes some time to get into, but once you got used to the switch it works fine. I recommend installing the game on a SSD hard disc, to minimize loading times when switching sessions. The military part of the game is not really well implemented. If you take it for what it is, a little diversion from the build-up part, it can be fun for while, though it really is always the same with not much depth or options. Then again, this isn't the focus of the game, so you could also just skip them entirely, if you want. They are not mandatory. If you look for a relaxing game, where you want to immerse yourself as a grand planner, and tweak the balances of consumption, production, power supply, workforce and logistics, then this game is for you. Overall it can be said that the game is excellent in the areas it is meant to be good at. For true build-up gamers this is a 10/10 game. There is enough build space to expand expand expand, build build build and create huge networks with huge cities. If you look for RTS combat or adventurer-style story telling with interesting plot twists, then this game is not really for you.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/anno-2205

Every time I play one, I feel I belong to a small secret society. Is it all nostalgia? The countless days, nights and weeks playing FTL’s Dungeon Master back in the late 80’s on my Atari ST? Or is it simply a matter of taste, this genre rubbing me the right way? The game mechanic similarities with Dungeon Master are, on the surface, obvious; you control a party of 4 heroes, orientating (in First Person View) through a grid-based dungeon, solving puzzles, finding keys and secrets, swinging swords and axes, shooting and dodging fireballs, drinking health/mana potions, finding loot/armor for upgrades, avoiding trapdoors and being freaked out by horrific monsters along the way. The combat is based on the “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism, which invites the player to approach battles with a more strategic view compared to the “hit-strafe-hit-strafe”-tactic (a.k.a. “dancing around your enemy”) found in Dungeon Master and some other grid-based dungeon crawlers (Legend of Grimrock comes to mind).In this, you fight most of your battles positioning your party right in front of your enemy, standing your ground. There are a few exceptions, though, as when you choose to dodge the Evil Watchers’ fireballs, or if you choose to attempt a retreat. With this system, the player conducts each individual party member to perform certain abilities, such as various attacks, healing/damage spells, buffs and much more. You want your tank to generate enough threat to keep the enemies targeting him, leaving the remaining party (healer and damage dealers) alone to focus on healing the tank (and other members when necessary) and attacking the enemy with melee and spellcasting. Keeping the enemies from attacking certain party members plays a big part in your eventual success. This makes for very interesting battles along the way, as the heroes learn more abilities for every gained level, while your enemies are getting stronger. To sum it up, the combat system is more MMO-based compared to most grid-based dungeon crawlers. On medium/high difficulty settings, it’s more than often necessary to use the built-in Pause function, which allows the player to completely halt the game, analysing the situation, queue abilities, assign potions to drink, and then unpause to see the action play through, until you wish/need to pause again. This can sound like interrupting gameplay flow for some players, but because of the difficulty level in some fights, it’s necessary, and in the end it becomes a natural part of game, something to become better and better at. The feeling of “being there” means almost everything in a game like this, and it really succeeds in achieving that feel. Knowing your position and bearing, keeping your back safe, looking for hidden buttons on mossy walls and analysing the haunting environment ahead. All these things become an obsession. You will revisit many labyrinth corridors during your mission, looking for secrets and hidden treasure, and there’s a certain feel when becoming “homey” in safe areas you’ve already cleared from enemies and monsters. It becomes a “safe haven”, and knowing the way back from where you came from can many times save your life, when you need to retreat from a group of a Cave Monsters or a poisonous Spider Queen. That’s what “keeping your back safe” is all about. The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is definitely not the type of game where you just storm forward recklessly, thinking you’re Rambo. Of course, you can set the difficulty level so extremely low that you actually can play like this (some might even enjoy it), but that’s not the main intention of this game. I had, and I’m having, a blast playing this game. It’s certainly a game that requires some time getting into. The combat system, including targeting enemies and timing your abilities, takes some getting used to. I can imagine players with a low experience of this kind of game struggling a bit in the beginning. That’s where the customizable difficulty settings come in – find your levels, play the game, get better, and when you’re ready for a challenge, raise the difficulty.The game is not perfect (it has some bugs), but with less than two weeks after official Steam release (at the time of this review), the developer has been very responsive to players’ bug reports, suggestions and feedback, releasing patches literally every day, not only fixing bugs but also enhancing the game in various aspects. I highly recommend this game. Not only for the obvious dungeon-freaks like myself out there, but I’m sure classic MMO/RPG players would enjoy this as well, as it has influences from more than one genre.

You have the mode of if you miss three fruit and/or slice three bombs you’ll lose. Another mode is just time based bombs are still there but you don’t lose, there’s just a delay in the fruit appearing. The third “Classic” mode is zen mode where again is time based but there are no bombs. There are four new single player modes that you can choose from in the “Festival” menu. Each new mode has a new character to introduce the new mode. Katsuro’s Ninja Dodge Dodge is a mode where shurikens are being thrown at you while slicing as much fruit as you can. More and faster shurikens are thrown as you successfully dodge more and more. Mari’s Strawberry Stealth puts your Ninja skills to the test by slicing fruit while avoiding moving spotlights. Being spotted sounds the alarm and points are lost the longer you stay in the spotlight. So if your shoulder just seen for a split second, less points are lost than if you do your best deer in a headlight impression and just stand there. Nobu’s Bamboo Strike is a mode where you have to slice the bamboo seeds before they hit the ground. Miss one and bamboo will grow to block you from slicing fruit. Han’s Apple Range is probably my favorite new mode. You have to throw knives at fruit instead of slice them. There are targets that pop down that you have to hit with your knives. Fruit Ninja 2 is $14.99 on the Xbox Store. In my opinion that’s a little pricey for a game that doesn’t have too much content. You can unlock all the game-modes in the matter of 15 minutes. Just like many Kinect games you can work up a bit of a sweat.

En route, you meet Dr. Harold Lang and this is where a routine train trip becomes an incredibly eerie experience. I wont elaborate on this because it will spoil the chilling and absorbing events that follow, but it will leave you deeeply engrossed throughout. The game mechanics are fairly basic which makes this a title that you can pick up and play straight away. Each chapter is fairly short though and solving the occasional 'puzzle' or what to do next to progress isn't all that challenging. These aren't criticisms though - the way the narrative champions itself outweighs any depth or difficulty concerns. The only real disappointment surrounding the game is the length - it will take you about two and a half to 3 hours to complete and the first two chapters are fairly limited although everything you accomplish has some bearing as the game flows nicely. You aren't walking around or searching aimlessly at any time so you feel you are always engaged in the product and everything has some merit. Despite the completion time; you will certainly get your money's worth for what is on offer and the intriguing writing. Overall, The Charnel House Triolgy is a terrific game that delivers a powerful and absorbing story supported with a truly unique art style.

If your foes won’t be your end, then the lack of crude, meat and power cells will surely make a dent in your quest. Your goal is to reach Aztec City where, rumors have it, a sanctuary can be found –  a new hope for life. It's clearly a rogue-like game that takes inspiration from Oregon Trail, XCOM and FTL with a little bit of Mad Max and Fallout sprinkled on top. I don't get why everyone is bashing the combat system - it's supposed to be this hard. You have to think to win a fight. There are so many dumbed down games nowadays that don't require any strategy whatsoever. Unfortunately, shallow titles have cemented themselves as the gaming industry's standard. It has to be incredible easy to play, filled with tutorials so everyone can jump on it and of course, have a safety net just in case you don't quite get the mechanics - aka a ton of checkpoints and the possibility to Save Game. Well, this is not the case with Skyshine's Bedlam. It stands tall with its middle finger pointed at the status quo. Combat is fun and enjoyable - if you spend time to actually learn it. The story unravels as you play. If you just go straight to Aztec City you'll be missing out on the fantastic lore made by John Mueller and his team. Sure, it can feel lackluster if you don't pay any attention to details, if you don't immerse yourself into Bedlam's universe.

After kicking butt in space, the final frontier, I struggled to see anywhere else developer Volition could take the beloved gangsters turned superheroes. Apparently there was still one place for them to go; hell. Given that this is a standalone expansion rather than the next full-fledged entry, it's missing some of the series most notable features. Mainly, character creation and traditional story missions. You play as fan favorite characters Johnny Gat and Kinzie Kensington. Progression through the brief narrative stages requires completing side-activities scattered throughout the new open-world setting. With the writing having taken something of a hit, Gat Out of Hell is more about the gameplay. You get some new powers and weapons at your disposal (most of which feel exactly like the old ones), but real star of the show is the new flight ability. It takes a while to get used to flying through the air. It wasn't until a handful of upgrades later that I really started to enjoy soaring across the city. Given the nature of the last Saints Row game I was surprised to find it a system that had some restrictions. Even after fully upgrading my angelic appendages I found myself yearning for the game-breaking freedom of Saints Row 4 when it came to taking to the skies. This really is just more of the same. The chaotic, destructive action is still a blast and the loop of completion and growth is just as satisfying and addicting as ever. There's nothing quite like watching yourself turn into a unstoppable powerhouse. The new underworld setting is very creative and visually distinct. Aside from being a cool visual aesthetic, hell also gives you plenty of room to stretch your newly acquired wings. Numerous collectibles are scattered across this fire and brimstone version of Steelport that will test your flight capabilities. The game is completely devoid of challenge. With the main campaign being so short, the life of the experience comes from the surprising amount of side-activities and achievements. While missing a few of my favorite features, I still found Gat Out of Hell to be a worthy way to return to the world of Saints Row. Things are just as crazy, absurd, and funny as ever. It's just not as fleshed out as my previous excursions with the series. As long as you don't go in expecting Saints Row V you should be fine. This an expansion that continues the gameplay experience from IV. It also serves as something of an epilogue to our adventures with these characters in ways I won't spoil. Suffice to say if you want to have just a little more fun with Volition's wacky gangster series and won't mind the nontraditional approach, then this is a must play.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/saints-row-gat-out-of-hell

In this context Shin Kamikaze, a human, get killed by some demons because he possess the right constitution to receive the power of the Fate Awakened Crystal, a gem that the angels want to use to turn a human into a powerful being that will fight for them in the war.After being rescued by the angels, he joins them, and with the support of the two co-protagonists of the game: the angel Jupiel and the demon Ariel, he will start to fight. I believe that the strong point of this game is the story, I warn you, that it follow a very ""japanese"" way of storytelling ( that you can like or dislike ), which blend together scenes from the daily routine of the different protagonists ( sometimes useless to the main story, but very interesting if you like to follow the development of the characters ) and serius/dramatic moments.If you like this kind of stories I belive that you will appreciate very much this game. From time to time, during the story, the protagonist will receive the task to choice how he want to change ""fate"": in terms of gameplay it means that the player will have to select between two given choice, how he want to perform certain actions, in my opinion this is a great feature and even after finishing the game, it will be worthy to start again from the beginning just to see what would had happened if you had selected different choices.Not always things will turn out the way we wanted, but I think that it should be obvious, since we are selecting just what ""the protagonist want to do"" and not what ""will absolutely happen"". In a certain sense after sometimes you'll really ""feel"" the pressure of the choice you are making ( it's important to note that sometimes the game become very cruel out of the blue, and even if it is just in the form of textuals descripcions some outcomes are very unpleasant ). - Graphic - In my opinion there are some games that don't need to push to the extreme the possibilities of a console, instead they just have to fit to style of the game.This is one of those cases, the graphic isn't very great, but it suit well with the story. The exploration of the labyrinth uses a low poly 3D graphic with bright colours, simple but very unique. When the story goes on, instead we have 2D drawing in japanese style of very good quality. - Recap - This is a very interesting game, with the right difficult to allow newcomers to enjoy it, and a storytelling able to satisfy many fans of j-rpg.The post-game contents are few and somewhat easy, so after the ending there would not be very much things to do, but the feature of the ""choices"" definitely leave the appeal to try to start again one or two times the game just to see what would have happened in different situations. However it's important to keep in mind that the game is not a masterpiece ( and neither tries to be one ), but anyway it does well its job to entertain during the time you'll need to finish it.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/the-awakened-fate-ultimatum

After beating the game I have to say that after the first battle this game becomes incredibly easy to play and beat because you figured out how to predict your enemies next attacks.  Sure it may be hard for some people, but because chess is hard for some people that doesn't mean it is a terrible game.  I enjoyed this game a lot, and I think that the things that can be improved upon are dramatically outweighed by the fact that the developers went out of their way to create a game that is fun and exciting. Another concern people have about this game is that there are not really any tutorials, and since I never have enjoyed tutorial sections in games before and always skip them when I can this is a welcome relief.

As such, this ""enhanced version"" features a couple of discrete additions, like Amiibo support (to unlock planes) and using the right stick to control the camera. The 3D effect is well done, but I tested it only with the N3DS. In the game's main mode, Missions, you are in the role of 'Phoenix', a very skilled pilot who has to fight the rebels in order to reestablish government's control of the country. It means you'll have to fight against rebel planes, ships and terrestrial defenses in order to complete your missions. This will give you around 5 to 10 hours, depending on the difficulty and how precise you are. The controls are responsive depending on the plane you choose and that can vary a lot.The extra modes (challenges), will add a couple of hours of gameplay, also unlocking some new stuff. There is also a theater mode where you can watch saved videos if you saved that gameplay when asked for. The game is fun, but it lacks things like multiplayer, a better use of the second stick and -maybe- a free flight mode to show off your cool new plane. I hope that, in the future, the next game from this franchise will add these features and deliver a more complete experience. The replayability is low, because after completing the game in all modes and levels, you will know every fight style of your enemies (the script), and the dialogs will start to become annoying. (I'm sorry if my English is too bad).",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/ace-combat-assault-horizon-legacy+

Life is Feudal is that game. While it's still a work in progress, the game already offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and fun. Warning: this game is ""hardcore"" (with exceptions- keep reading). Synopsis of gameplay:It's an open medieval sandbox world that's ready to be transformed by you and your fellow knights (FYI, to be successful, you'll typically need to play this game with friends or with other players that you meet in game). You start in the wilderness, with hardly any clothes, and gather edible food to stay alive, along with plant fiber and sticks to create primitive tools. With these tools, you slowly become self-sufficient: building a house for yourself, farmland, crafting equipement, and digging a mine. Soon, you have a little village going! Maybe even build a palisade wall around it to help keep out hostile players! ;) Multiplayer:It's very important that you play this game with other people because LIF revolves around having to use teamwork to succeed. One cannot learn all the skills, yet each skill supplments the other. So if you hope to eventually make a small village, don't expect to do it with just your hermit-self. You need a specialized blacksmith, farmer, miner, builder, and alchemist to get everything done! And hopefully multiples of each ;) IMPORTANT: Use in-game global chat to FIND other players, or search the LIF website forums for groups in need of more members! (don't just walk around aimlessly in-game). ^There IS an exception: Private servers can be personalized by the admin to allow players larger skill caps (to obtain most available skills) as well as skill multipliers, which make work/leveling faster, potentially allowing you to play solo, or for shorter periods of time. But this is not the original ""vanilla"" version of the game. Pros:-I've never had so much fun playing a game before. Give it adaquete time before you judge it.-Medieval realism, sandbox, open world, terraforming, no-target combat, full-loot PvP. Pinch me I'm dreaming.-Player-built and player-run world. No NPCs. Cons (potential):-Very difficult learning curve. It's hard to familearize yourself with game mechanics.-The game is very hardcore (UNLESS you are playing on a severely customized server). If you're a Call of Duty fan, leave before it's too late!-You're going to need to put A LOT of time into this game if you want to build a completed settlement with your mates. The journey, while slow, is a fun one though. If you don't have the time, try waiting for the MMO version (where settlements will likely demand a smaller share of responsibility from you).-Being in Alpha, some elements are naturally not working as well as they should be (ie. smoothness of combat, wild animals, occassional crashing). BUT the deveopment team is extremely active, and updates are always rolling out. This game is even exponentially better than it was a week ago (I was a pre-alpha tester for months outside steam).-This 64 player version (MMO info is below) does not prioritize combat. There is no clear mechanic that allows for competing groups of players to wage war against each other in order to destroy each other's settlements. (You can still fight for the sake of fighting though and kill each other). But if you are looking for soley a combat/fighting game, do not get this. It's design leans towards crafting and building the world around you. Long term goal:This is the 64 player version of a larger MMO that they are trying to generate funding for. The MMO's success rides on the success of this smaller game. Both have the same gameplay mechanics, so development of one equally benefits the other. (FYI: Sieging/large-scale combat will be more prevalent in the MMO).",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/life-is-feudal-your-own

After beating the game I have to say that after the first battle this game becomes incredibly easy to play and beat because you figured out how to predict your enemies next attacks. Sure it may be hard for some people, but because chess is hard for some people that doesn't mean it is a terrible game. I enjoyed this game a lot, and I think that the things that can be improved upon are dramatically outweighed by the fact that the developers went out of their way to create a game that is fun and exciting. Another concern people have about this game is that there are not really any tutorials, and since I never have enjoyed tutorial sections in games before and always skip them when I can this is a welcome relief.

Especially the ""locked room"" types where you were alone in a creepy place and had to find clues and tools to escape? Okay. Mix these two together and you have Morningstar. This is not a game in shiny armor (so it doesn't have much movemment and action during the game), but it sure has a feeling that will pull you back until you have finished with the whole quest. The main story is a bit of a cliche - stranded in an alien planet, okay. But in the other hand the atmosphere is really cool, the graphics are nice and the ingame ambient soundscapes are giving you the chills. You find items, combine them and use them in the right places, solve puzzles (not too easy and not extremely hard either) to advance. Let's see the highs and lows: + Great overall atmosphere+ Nice bunch of tasks and puzzles+ Excellent intro and outro movies with a superb orchestral soundtrack+ Chilling ingame ambient music - Voice acting is flat sometimes- Overall game is too short (even without the clues you can make it in maximum 2-3 hours) My rating is 90%. I wanted to give less at first, because it's a nostalgia game with many static screens and a bit too short. But playing it through I have found that it has a great atmosphere that overwrites all my scepticism. And looking at the credits you will find that it is made by a very small group of people (1 writer, 1 general artist-programmer, 1 music artist and 2 voice actors), so I guess it's more than superb work from a really small group of adventure fanatics.

Similar story, similar way of completing the challenges. In my eyes this is a good thing, since Portal is an excellent game. It does not however feel like a clone, more like... a 1st cousin. The intro had a wiff of the intro in HL1, which gave me happy feelings all over. The design of the rooms is great. It's gritty, metal, very... prison-y. The voiceacting is believable and well performed. Very shortly after the game begins you hope that you'll get some 1 on 1 time with the warden. The soundtrack is fitting, not intrusive, adds an extra dimension to the gameplay, just as music is supposed to. All in all, one of the better singleplayer games i've played since... well...

I kinda like this game so this is a bit long. To summarize, this is a great game if you like arpgs, ship battles, or group play. This is not a game that really supports a single player playstyle. The first thing I want to say is that if you only play the single player you will be really gimping yourself. The second thing is that this is a freshly released ARPG, much as D2 and D3, I think that the potential of this game is vast. In the last four days I've seen the developer online communicating with the playerbase, on discussions forums, and on the subreddit. The community of windward is one that works together and at odds of one another for pure fun; the initial factions easily swapped and online it can be amusing to watch the pvp as some people may switch sides or go pirate and fight all sides in a zone. The depth of windward is in its progression. Upgrading the gear on your ship is one type, however so it upgrading the ship itself. In fact I would go so far as to say that the ship upgrade really makes the ""gear game"" a non-issue (and therefore not a grind). This is the first ARPG where I got to a high level without ever feeling like I needed to just grind out mobs/quests (not to say that you don't, but I didn't notice it). Killing ships and trying to get enough money to get to the next ship I want was a ton of fun, the multiplayer aspect of it in the early and mid game was fantastic, trying out pvp around level 30 and being able to compete with someone 30 levels above me (due to the server option of having level scaling turned on) was a lot of fun. As I entered the start of the endgame, level 50, I joined the Syndicate. A faction you only qualify for as level 50+. Factions are nothing more than flags you equip in a flag gear slot, they are not to difficult to earn from the various factions either. (I got them all simply by joining combat instances with other players and killing pirates) The graphics for this game were better than I expected, particularly with a single developer behind the wheel. The gameplay is very well polished, there are a few bugs (being slung 1/2 way across the map on to land after a MASSIVE 8 ships to ships collision was hilarious)  but nothing that interrupted my fun. The community is fantastic, the veterans of this game consistently invite and help out lower level players (and are encouraged to through the way the Heroic system works), spawn ships for loot, and the developer himself is in touch with the people playing. One downside of this is that the game is very much made for group play, if you want a single player experience I would not recommend this because it is fundamentally designed for more than one player at a time. At a certain point (I think 70) all instances are scaled to be completed with 3+ players and there is a minor trinity system in place with the specializations, equipment, and ships. You can be a Tank, Offensive damage, or support (Healing/buffing/Debuffing). . Heroic instances make use of this with a max of 12 ships in the instance. There is normally a 1-4 Ships of the line (Tanks), 5-8 damage specced ships, 1-3 Support specced ships... and its a BLAST. Due to the way the level scaling works you can get into these at level 50. You unlock the Orange faction (Can I just say the legendary faction?As in being a legendary captain?) at level 150, and then you continue to unlock very interesting abilities as you increase in level. I find the depth in this game to be in the progression, the community, and in the smaller aspects of gameplay like how the various playstyles fit together. Even though this game is out of early access and IS a complete game, it is still under patch support and revision, much like other ARPGs (*cough* Diablo) the potential of windward is greater than the current rendition of the game and I cannot wait to see what it will play like over the next 6 months.Ign: Fortune.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/windward

Founded by Trevor Stricker, a veteran of AAA titles such as the NBA 2k series.You play as the ""great spirit"" of the Mofongo tribe of monkeys, assisting them against a rival clan of Red Monkey who keep stealing their bananas. Your job is to use the rhythm of the music to guide the monkeys along the map to coconuts which they may use as weapons againt their red enemies. But it's soon discovered that there is bigger ""monkey business"" at hand than rival primate factions, such as humans with bulldozers tearing up their rain forest.The first obvious thing that you may, or rather WILL notice, about this games which make it unique is the screen orientation: there have been games in the past that offer you the OPTION of playing the game using ""vertical"" screen orientation, but this is the first game that I recall, which requires you to play the game holding your Vita in the vertical position. It feels wierd at first and it takes some getting used to,similar to a console controller, most handheld gamers are used to having a ""wide"" device between their hands (and the Security that comes with). but once you start playing the game and you really get into it (which you will), you won't even notice the difference.The art style just screams made in the US. It reminds me very much of some Nickelodeon cartoon a kid would like. The entire design of the game is simple and easy to look at. Colors are sharp, and everything is ""not too much, not too little""Controls are as simple as controls can possibly get. You simply move to the rhythm and tap the screen to tell your monkey minions where to go. In the beginning of the game there's a short tutorial showing you how many times to tap the screen to get your monkey to move, as well as how many taps to target enemies and throw coconuts.The music is practically the life of the entire game, without the smooth jungle tunes, there would be no ""Rumble"". The rhythmic beats act as your guide throughout the game, helping you along with your progress through the story, just follow the rhythm, and you are golden (your score will be as well).Possible moves will be hilighted on screen so you will never be lost as to your next move, but remember, your score is largely based on time, so use strategy, good timing, and think smart. This is one of those titles you will truly get good at once you finally, ""become one"" with the experience.Gameplay: 8Bucks worth: 8Effects: 7Content: 7Good: Cute cartoon style graphics, simple story, easy control sceneBad: my bananas are missing...Verdict: this is one of the best rhythm based games I've played in the past year, and anybody who collects this genre of game should pick it up from the PSN now.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/jungle-rumble-freedom-happiness-and-bananas

He has a crush on a sexy female cop and thinks the only way to get her attention is by becoming a superhero on a reality TV show. Thanks to a bonk on the head, Kyle not only thinks he's a superhero but also gains a set of patriotic super powers, and a Superhuman Love of FREEDOM. The puzzles embody the spirit of classic adventure games from the old LucasArts/Sierra period. For some, this means a return to the glory days of challenging mysteries and zany characters. For others, it's a return to a nightmarish world of cruel puzzles that don't make a bit of sense until AFTER they've been solved. When Kyle encounters a puzzle, the solution usually involves a complex chain of events where the first step has no rational connection to the desired outcome. Often they involve picking up an random item in a far location, then carrying it around until Kyle finds a use for it. There are also many sequences where the player will have the right object in the right place, but can't use it until Kyle has spoken to a particular character. There are several red herrings where there is an obvious solution to Kyle's problem, but the designers force the player to jump through a bunch of hoops before letting them do the obvious thing. One sequence requires him to change into his civilian clothes, so naturally, the player might try to use Kyle's closet. Alas, Kyle has to run all over town trying several wacky schemes before he can return home and use the very closet that players probably tried at the start of the quest. The designers are aware of the absurdities of all this, and they included a self-aware character named Mel who hangs around with Kyle and makes fun of gaming cliches. Mel always has a witty observation, but his jokes don't alleviate the frustration of running in circles, clicking on every object and character in an endless series of non sequiturs. Fortunately, Mel also doubles as a help system: The dimwitted/brain-damaged Kyle can always seek out Mel's advice on what he should be doing, and how to do it. It's a clever take on a hint system that doesn't feel quite so much like cheating. The puzzles and level design are still brutal, even with Mel's assistance. That could be forgiven if the humor was more effective, but the gags tend to be juvenile, dated references to reality TV and celebrity culture. Some are so dated that one wonders how long the project has been in development (since “hanging chads” were topical, presumably). Sometimes the dialog is punctuated with eye-rolling bits of irreverent, politically-incorrect humor. Observations along the lines of ""ladies sometimes have artificial bosoms"". Or ""fellows who engage in homosexuality might dress flamboyantly"". Mel expresses disapproval of the more offensive comments, but that doesn't make it any more entertaining to see the same gay stereotype show up in every episode, or hearing endless jokes about transexuals and hermaphrodites. The designers even go so far as to poke fun at other games, including Mass Effect 3 (again with the outdated cultural references). A particularly damning moment is when they call Duke Nukem “juvenile” and “misogynistic”. This happens in between the fart jokes and breast implant innuendo. The story is about a Captain America sort of hero, but the game itself is rather a bit British. Most of the dialog is spoken by Mel, who is from England and has a thick accent, but even the American characters have some distinctly British phrasing. Not to mention the superfluous ""U""s that pop up in words like “favour”. A little mistake on the part of the script's ""editours"". On occasion, Supreme League of Patriots does find a good joke. Kyle's superhero alter ego, The Purple Patriot, is a combination of Stephen Colbert and The Tick. He has a well-intended childlike idiocy that results in a few laugh-out-loud moments, and Mel also gets in a few dry quips―between the references to Amanda Bynes' driving record. Despite its premise, Supreme League of Patriots doesn't have many insights into the superhero genre. It is divided into three episodes, but The Purple Patriot doesn't really fight crime until the final episode. For the first third of the game, the focus is on spoofing reality TV, then the second episode mostly follows him as he deals with bureaucracy in obtaining his Superhero License. Even when the superheroics start in the third episode, there is a lot of time spent running around on mundane errands. SLoP will frustrate all but the most die-hard adventure game fans. The humor isn't consistent enough to mitigate the annoying puzzle design, and the story is too farcical to emotionally engage the player. For the hardcore adventure gamer, it's on PC/iOS/Linux now.

LA Cops is lighter in tone - the cut scenes for example give a welcome injection of humour in between levels - while the gameplay itself feels like a more equitable trade off between player skill and simple luck. Can't wait for the co-op mode that I hear is being worked on, as that will be an added bonus.

Из огня он вышел целым и невредимым... Lucius II - достойный сиквел к 1 части. На этот раз нам предстоит окунуться в жизнь обычного душевно-больного пациента. На уничтожение нам дана больница Святого Бенедикта и небольшой городок Ладлоу. Здесь все зависит от нас, как мы решим, так и будет. Думаю, основная цель второй части всем понятна : Уничтожать все и вся на своем пути. Мы сами выбираем какие нам прокачивать способности, хоть поджигание, хоть телекинез, хоть контроль разума. В самом начале нас встречают очень "" тепло "" и мы оказываемся на нулевом уровне, а именно на обучении. Если называть самый худший уровень Lucius II, то им, конечно же, окажется обучение. В течение этих десяти минут нас познакомят с игрой, но сделают это ужасно скучно и занудно. После "" интересного "" обучения мы попадаем прямиком в игру, где нам показывают заставки, выполненные в стиле рисовки. Оригинальное решение, что сказать. Мы узнаем, что Люциус очень плохо себя вел и его ведут на шоковую терапию. Результат : куча убитых санитаров. Дальше, собственно, мы начинаем игру. Что касается геймплея, то, по моему мнению разработчики сделали правильное решение, превратив линейный квест в песочницу. Именно это и является одним из главных достоинств Lucius II. Что касается графической составляющей, то тут у меня претензий нет - все сделано красиво и качественно. Саундтрек был написан великолепный, который завораживает с самого начала. Что же касается реализации, то тут все хуже. Обильное количество багов хоть и забавляет, но иногда мешает хорошей и спокойной игре. Иногда хочешь убить жертву каким-то кровожадным образом, но не можешь, так как эта жертва застряла в стене, заглючила или вообще исчезла. Иногда происходящее поражает : Убил ты человека, пришла медсестра, оказала первую помощь, а когда поняла что пациент мертв... Просто ушла как будто ничего не случилось. Lucius 2 мастерски сочетает в себе несколько элементов разных жанров. От забавного момента с геями в туалете до отрезания головы вентилятором. Игра вышла слишком короткая, поэтому советую подольше задерживаться на каждом уровне. Как бы не старались Shiver Games, гениального продолжения у них не получилось, однако они сделали хорошую игру.

Some are broken souls, some are merely damaged - all are fighting to forge a future in an ugly world ruled by those whose hearts are cruel and dark. - Seven levels split across three acts.- Fully voiced, rich mystery plot.- Stunning visual style inspired by classic film noir cinema.- Explore a richly detailed and atmospheric world.- Coordinate multiple unique characters with a range of skills.- Use stealth or brute force to face those that stand in your way.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/calvino-noir
