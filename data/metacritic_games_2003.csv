Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors.

Condemned to death by Chancellor Sopot, six super-soldiers unite to save their country, vowing to overthrow Sopot using the unique powers that nano-technology has given them. Join the squad as Alias, a demolitions expert. Fight side-by-side with Molov, Repta, Shrike, Tangier, and Quill--each possessing unique attributes and specialties. Battle through diverse environments using vehicles, an arsenal of specialized weapons, and explosives in a mission to overthrow the government. Defeat Sopot and restore the honor of the Commonwealth!

The Rangers, an elite law enforcement organization, pose the only real threat to this sinister plot. To thwart their investigations, the conspirators orchestrate a campaign to undermine the Rangers with infiltration, sabotage, and false incrimination. Ranger Mace Griffin is framed in such a set-up and sentenced to ten years on Penal Colony Delta. In prison, Mace becomes introverted and embittered, and swears to take revenge on those who have wronged him. With the dissolution of the Rangers, law enforcement is left to the Enforcers, who prove incapable of controlling the Vagner System's criminal element. To deal with the rising wave of crime, a new organization emerges: the Guild of Bounty Hunters. A group of both terrans and aliens, it includes former members of the police and military, along with known criminals. The guild is not particular about who joins?as long as they have proven combat ability. Intent on revenge, Mace Griffin sets up as a bounty hunter. The benefits are threefold: a constant stream of cash, access to classified information, and a license to explore the Vagner Frontier System and find out who was behind his downfall and that of the Rangers.

The game is all about speed. The track editor has unlimited posibilities in the game. You can choose from all over the world, and I mean anyhere in the world! And when you pick it you will start building your track. like most level editors like in tony hawk, the track building is total manual control. meaning turning the degrees of your track up or down,left,right,side to side. just how to explain how you make the track is put all of those words that I just said and mix it up. I dont know,its kinda difficult just how the track building works. but its totally like you never seen before. and its vary easy to do. and it has a tutorials so you can lern about the track editor and its easy to lern. its like a 2 step generation of level editors of this day. you can aso put scenery on your track. like different bridges style and a audience and lights on your track and buidings and trees and bill boards and many other stuff. and you can move these objects in any angle and in the world. and you can change the time and weather and track themes. and you can change the ground to snowy or braked earth, themes like that. and you can change the track style to by different track textures and waves on the track and track barriers styles and track barrier height and even to invisible track. it aso has a highlighter track thing to put stuff like that. the game is actually easy! Just press the R2 or L2 for when you are going too fast or hard turns. makes the game a lot easer for me. there's sooo much I havent explained about the track editor but trust me its ReaIIIILLLY BIG!!! so if you like the fucherictic racing with fast speeds and big jumps that just make you feel,wooh! and the EXSLUSIVE! track editor than this is your game! you will probly not find it in stores now but look on ebay. you will find it there. just make sure it has a 100% feed back and in good condition.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/hsx-hypersonicxtreme
