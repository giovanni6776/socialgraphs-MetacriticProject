It is great we also get a level select option, although I will say that it is clear that this isn't the intended way to play the game as some of the later levels don't give you many weapons (the levels were originally intended to play in one go so that your weapons are brought through). If they could add more weapons throughout some later levels (like extra double barrel shotguns) that would be great (fact: all Doom levels were double balanced to ensure a pistol start is possible).

I've seen it compared to all sorts of titles, all across the genre spectrum - Zelda, Souls, HLD... - which, I believe, speaks to its true uniqueness. Though you will find familiar elements in exploration, graphics and combat to things you might have played before, believe me: the ensemble is something altogether different. The combat is amazingly fan and incredibly fluid - quite honestly, I believe it has the most satisfying parry timing/feel of anything I've ever played. Exploration is awesome: from the get-go you can go pretty much anywhere, and though the sequence you get the items affects your progression, it never stalls it. It's a very clever level and world-design that encourages exploration and makes revisiting earlier areas a joy and not a bother. The ""time limit"" was, I must admit, something I was a little bit skeptical about initially. I'm more of a chill gamer, and I was afraid it'd make me anxious - but it surprisingly didn't, not at all! I think the way the time limit works (which I will not say because it's a plot spoiler) is VERY unique and it ends up serving more as a plot point (and a very engaging one at that!) than as a true limitation. It forces you to make decisions and manage time and resources, but it is very fair and forgiving (I've been playing in the standard difficulty - I'm sure the highest level offers a more unforgiving and challenging experience for those who seek it). The art is something else. Some of the prettiest pixel art I've seen in my life, and it's unbelievable it was all done by such a small development team. The cutscenes are moving, the parallaxes are out of this world, and all the tiny details (the reflections, the rain drops, the bounce-back frames) are a feast for the eyes. Finally, the soundtrack: it is at the same time widely diverse and incredibly cohesive and consistent. There are many earworms which will be stuck to your brain for hours after you've stopped playing, but there are also many chill, ambient tracks that perfectly match the post-apocalyptic setting. All in all, UNSIGHTED is an INCREDIBLE game that you should pick up right now.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/unsighted

The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma.

With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harbouring.

The time/effort saved by not having to manage the monsters means I can do 2-3 scenarios here for every one scenario I would have done on Tabletop Simulator. Additionally, the game looks good, which is certainly pleasant. And the extent to which the game recaptures and recreates the board game campaign is more faithful than I ever could have imagined it would be. If you've never played the board game and have no idea what I'm talking about, whether this game is interesting to you or not is just going to depend on whether you like turn-based tactical dungeon crawlers. Gloomhaven is probably the best turn-based tactical dungeon crawler of all time. Do note that this is less RPG and more ""puzzle"" than you probably expect. It's not a puzzle in the sense that you have to solve pre-created puzzles, but rather the stamina and action system will make turns and scenarios into combat/optimization puzzles. You won't be rushing in with your tank, healing them with your healer, and dpsing with your damage-dealers. You'll evaluate the board and try to figure out the best way to get through the room, killing the enemies while taking as little damage as possible and expending as few resources as possible. All that being said, there are some RPG-like elements in the sense of the campaign progress: you earn gold and experience with which you improve your character over time. Additionally, you'll improve the town itself over time, which unlocks additional items for purchase. Most significantly, your characters will all have life goals and when they complete them, you'll unlock completely new classes to play (there are 6 starting classes and 11 locked classes). The mechanics of most classes are so significantly different that the novelty and excitement of unlocking and getting to try these new, different classes is amazing. So that's all of the good, how about the bad? Well, honestly, at this point, just bugs. Lots and lots and lots of bugs. In about 40 hours of play since the campaign released, I encounter on average one bug per scenario. They are pretty much never game-breaking or scenario-ruining bugs, but they are definitely there. Additionally, many scenarios have special rules that aren't adequately explained in the UI currently. I know that both of these issues are currently being heavily worked on and the company plans on continuing to support the game for a long time, so I'm sure these problems will be resolved, but for now they do drag the score down a bit unfortunately. Regardless, I still would not hesitate to recommend this game, and the longer it's been since this review was written that you're reading it, the more likely the game is even better than the assessment I gave here.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/gloomhaven

Though there's no quick command to call for backup when you're outnumbered, or when you've spotted an enemy, you can coordinate with attacks and passing. Small things like passing to level up your ball and coordinating a strike with team players. VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF DODGEBALL. –There are a variety of dodgeball gametypes that rotate on a weekly basis (Think like Splatoon, but because everything lasts a week rather than a day it's a lot easier to do what you want to do). There are both team games and free for alls, so keep a lookout for what cool events there are on the week you're playing. LEVEL UP AND STYLE UP! –This is a season pass game, but the season pass is free. That means you get a good feeling of progression constantly as you gain experience, and earning a reward at each level. The rewards can be the game's currency that you can spend at the 24-hour rotating shop, or they can be cosmetics for your character (You can instantly flip between 3 character designs if you can't settle on one) or even your profile. As far as I've seen, each player gets different unlocks for each level as they're randomly assigned (And sorted from the usual uncommon to legendary rarity). That means after the first round, it's going to be incredibly rare that you'll encounter another player that looks like you. Unless of course, for maximum threat, you and your crew don the same look. CREWS –Make a crew with your friends and work together to earn additional challenges to net XP and currency. These challenges can include ones specifically where you play with teammates, or you can just play solo and contribute to the team counters for a weekly challenge such as ""Get 100 KOs"". If your crew accomplished this task at the beginning of the week without you and you log in at the end of the week before the new week rolls in, you reap the rewards too! You will have your own team insignia which glows on the back of your jacket, and a specific car design that always drops your team off to the battlefield, all for the sake of style. BOTTOM LINE –It's free till level 25. It's absolutely worth trying it out, and if you like it, it's absolutely worth supporting the developer for a fun game. If you have Xbox Gamepass Ultimate, it's entirely free, so there's definitely no excuse to not pick it up.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/knockout-city

It is as close to Blade Runner in video game form as you will find. It wasn’t without issues though. My problems with the game are either the result of poor mechanics; they were on purpose; or I am just bad at the game. My main issue with the game were it’s rating system of your interrogations. I didn’t feel they were very fair. It seemed that pretty much every interrogation I did was not handled to their satisfaction. The thing is I was actually trying to do what they wanted, I wasn’t trying to be some rebel and free all of the androids. I ended up being decommissioned as a deviant and many of the dialogue responses I got to use at that point acted as if I was part of some underground movement trying to overthrow the company. I guess I just sucked at the job but there was no option for that story arc. Putting this aside I did enjoy the game. There is a lot of different questions you can ask and the game does a good job of letting you know what kind of response you are getting as well as things you can try to get the responses you need. The graphics are decent all around. I didn’t feel that there were any parts of them that either wowed me or made me cringe in horror. The music was well done. The script was very good and being that there was no voice acting this was important. I played Silicon Dreams on Linux. It never crashed on me and, outside of a slight v-sync issue, I didn’t notice any bugs or spelling mistakes. There was a toggle for v-sync; three options for AA and a resolution selector. Alt-tab didn’t work. You can save the game on exit but there is only one save slot. The v-sync was also a bit broken. During interrogations it worked just fine but outside of it either in your room or in the debrief it didn’t work and the FPS was much higher.  Performance was great although there were times I was surprised at the high usage of CPU and GPU as well as thinking the frame rate should have been higher based on the graphical quality. That being said there was no lag and the frame rate was always well above 60. Game Engine: UnityGraphics API: OpenGLGame Version Played: 11.10.2021Disk Space Used: 3.7 GB Game Settings: V-sync on; 8x AA; 1920x1080GPU Usage: 0-100 %VRAM Usage: 830-1372 MBCPU Usage: 17-65 %RAM Usage: 3.4-4.0 GBFrame Rate: 71-144 FPS Even though I may have been bad at the game I still had fun which is the key here. If the whole point was that it wasn’t possible to please the company then I still say bravo. I recommend this game to anybody who enjoys detective style games or just visual novel games as that’s what this game is at it’s core. I paid $19.80 CAD and finished Silicon Dreams in 1 hour and 51 minutes. I’m not sure if I reached the end of the game naturally or my bad performance sped it up but overall the game didn’t feel rushed and didn’t drag. I would try the demo first to make sure it is what you like. My System: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X | 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 | MSI RX 580 8GB Gaming X | Mesa 21.2.6 | Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB |  Linux Mint 20.3 | Mate 1.26.0 | Kernel 5.4.0-104-generic | AOC G2460P 1920*1080 @ 144hz",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/silicon-dreams

That's coming from a man who spent 1000+ hrs in games from civ franchise (from 1 to 6), 1000+ hrs in paradox strategies like EU4, Stellaris, CK 2/3 and HoI IV, 100+ hrs in Total War games, and countless hours in other strategies like Endless franchise, HoMM III and others. If you like a 4k or strategy games in general you most definitely will like it, as it brings numerous improvements and innovations for 4X genre. Its main systems (events, characters, families, orders,  trading, production) are quite robust and well-thought-out and fundamentals are strong.The game kept my attention for the entirety of my runs (I'm well over 150 hrs of playing time currently) - the thing I can not say about some other strategy games. Some of them are too long (EU4), in some (like in the Total War series) you get to snowball very fast getting a decisive advantage pretty early, and then the game becomes a chore (because you already ""won"", but you need to keep playing for a long time to actually claim it) and Old World has none of it - 200 max turns, perfect victory conditions and overall balance of early-mid-late game are all just in the right spot for me. It focuses on one era and does it well, providing a tight, well-tuned experience. Game systems have a lot of depth - so you will learn many new things even after hundreds of hours. Good things are to be said about the overall balance of the game - compared to ...some... (YES, I'M POINTING AT YOU CIV VI), where devs release new civilizations or features without any after-thought of actually balancing it. All things I said apply even to the highest difficulty and I'm really glad it does, as difficulty can really skew perception, alter your playing style and limit things that can work - here it actually remains about the same - just more challenging (however, I have to say, for most players, even veterans, this game will be much more difficult than Civ - AI is not amazing but better (especially combat AI) and, while getting more advantages from the start, it doesn't ""cheat"" afterwards like in Civ, just gets a head start. There are a lot of options, so you can adjust it for yourself just fine. Replayability is pretty much endless, you already most certainly can sink hundreds and thousands of hours into it.The game soundtrack is awesome, and the overall graphic design of the game has a coherent, theme-fitting style to it.The main criticism for me would be performance issues (the game is so good I actually don't mind, but they are real - it runs worse than any other strategy game out there I've played, tho graphics are nothing special, some would even call it ""outdated"") and overall ""scope"" so to say. It is just an initial release and the dev team is quite small (but very passionate and actively engaging with the community), so there are not what many different civs or overall content in terms of raw numbers (only 7 civs, 5 tribes, the overall number of systems/units e.t.c.), however, to me it is not a downside, because it makes the game tighter, civs balanced, each system having a meaningful place, tho some people may have a different opinion.The tutorial is quite bare-bones as of July 2021, but I definitely got hang of its systems just fine, and the learning curve was quite smooth, but my perception on this subject is definitely skewed.Overall, I will without hesitation say that Old World is one of my favourites now and the best strategy game I've played in a while, so despite not being perfect in every aspect, it gets 10/10 personally for me. It is awesome and you should try it too.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/old-world

This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with unique animal AI, real-time world destruction, and organic exploration and puzzle design to create emergent gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same.Your Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don't replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways. Each mutation will also change the physical look of a Trebhum and stacking these will generate near countless surprising new creature designs which players will be able to organically discover as they explore this unique alien ecosystem. Game Features:* Unforgettable Alien World to explore: Players must explore a gorgeous procedurally generated world which is populated with unforgettable vistas and unique landscapes which have something new to discover around every corner. The Eternal Cylinder features an open-world which allows players to reach and explore any areas which they can see on the horizon. This encourages constant exploration and ensures that there's always something new to see. * Real-Time World Destruction: Everything in the world can be destroyed in real-time by The Eternal Cylinder, so players must continuously evade its destructive path in order to survive whilst marveling at the visual splendor of its godlike power.Story Driven Open-World Survival: Unlike many open-world survival titles, The Eternal Cylinder features a deep and engrossing story for players to uncover as they continue to explore the vast world. The game explores themes of family and heritage, and the lasting power of knowledge.* Build Your Own Alien Family: Unlike standard survival games where you have a main shelter that you can build or improve, in Eternal Cylinder players develop a nomadic herd of unique alien creatures called Trebhums. Players control one Trebhum from the herd at a time and the rest follow (Al controlled) but players can switch to any individual member of their herd at will. Explore the world to rescue more of your brethren and continuously expand your family. Control a herd which can grow to more than 20 members at any given time and imbue each of your Trebhums with their own unique mutations and skill sets. Players can create a custom name for each of their Trebhum, increasing the emotional bond between player and their Trebhum family. * Unique Mutation System: Although Trebhum's are generally frail and start their lives at the very bottom of the world's food chain, they have the unique ability to mutate and unlock new skills by consuming natural edibles which populate the game world. So, players must explore and experiment with a vast array of fruits, flora and alien creatures to unlock new powers and gameplay options. * 50+ Mutations to discover: Players can unlock more than 50+ unique mutations as they explore the world, each one of which enable new gameplay options. These include new traversal options such as the ability to fly and swim, but also new offensive moves like the ability to spit fire and create loud warning noises. New mutations allow players to explore new areas and each mutation stacks thus creating a truly expansive skill set which is constantly evolving. * A Trebhum for everyone: Enjoy a virtually endless visual variety of Trebhum designs, as each mutation combine with one another to create surprising new creatures. This allows your herd to continue to evolve as players explore new areas and players can share the unique look of their Trebhum family with the rest of the world online. * Layered Survival: Players need to manage multiple layers of resources in order to be able to survive. These include hydration level, various temperatures each with their own impact and stamina. * Living and Breathing Ecosystems: The world of The Eternal Cylinder is populated with more than 30 memorable handcrafted alien creatures. These creatures vary greatly in size and range from those smaller than a Trebhum, all the way to skyscraper sized leviathans who dominate the horizon. Each of these creatures feature their own dedicated Al and behave in natural ways. Players must learn their unique behaviors and discover surprising ways to utilize the natural food chain to their advantage and interact with every creature. * Organic Puzzle Solving and Progression: The world of the Eternal Cylinder has been designed to empower players to organically solve its mysteries and progress without the need for obvious prompts and mission logs. This allows for fully immersive exploration which rewards players of every skill level, as the greater majority of the puzzles are not required for progression but do provide unique experiences. * 4 Unique Biodomes lo Discover ond Explore: Players can explore 4 unique biodomes including alien savannas and infected habitats, each with their own dedicated ecosystems and unique creatures to discover. * Truly Emergent Gameplay: The Eternal Cylinder's lush procedurally generated world, vast number of mutations to discover and unlock, unique creature Al system, living natural ecosystem, real-time world destruction and organically placed puzzles combine to create near endless possibilities for emergent gameplay and help to ensure that no two playthroughs will ever be there same.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-eternal-cylinder

( it's the first time i see a mistake like that in a game, it's pretty amusing. it's like the timer in undertale now, all nonsensical long numbers. )2- the graphics seem to not have been properly ported in some places, for example, characters a lot of the time don't have their mouths visible, you have to focus and see the jagged lines from the edge of the mouths to know what they are emoting at that moment.  some prompt boxes ( like, x joined your party ) seem to have been done in photoshop as they have visible black borders about idk, 200~300 px away from the actual box. if you play this and have some experience in action games or hack and slash, just jump in on expert mode ( you can change it later ), it's pretty easy and you get a lot of nice equipment and items.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/ni-no-kuni-ii-revenant-kingdom---princes-edition

This unique ecosystem is a massive, procedurally generated land with unique animal AI, real-time world destruction, and organic exploration and puzzle design to create emergent gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs are ever the same.Your Trebhums begin at the bottom of the natural food chain but can mutate and evolve with new physical attributes and abilities by eating a variety of flora and fauna. Discover and adapt dozens of mutations, including new traversal skills like flying and swimming to reach new areas, and new senses to help overcome puzzles, challenges and dangers. Your many Trebhums can each have different mutations, and new mutations don't replace ones you already have, letting you stack ability sets in dynamic ways. Each mutation will also change the physical look of a Trebhum and stacking these will generate near countless surprising new creature designs which players will be able to organically discover as they explore this unique alien ecosystem. Game Features:* Unforgettable Alien World to explore: Players must explore a gorgeous procedurally generated world which is populated with unforgettable vistas and unique landscapes which have something new to discover around every corner. The Eternal Cylinder features an open-world which allows players to reach and explore any areas which they can see on the horizon. This encourages constant exploration and ensures that there's always something new to see. * Real-Time World Destruction: Everything in the world can be destroyed in real-time by The Eternal Cylinder, so players must continuously evade its destructive path in order to survive whilst marveling at the visual splendor of its godlike power.Story Driven Open-World Survival: Unlike many open-world survival titles, The Eternal Cylinder features a deep and engrossing story for players to uncover as they continue to explore the vast world. The game explores themes of family and heritage, and the lasting power of knowledge.* Build Your Own Alien Family: Unlike standard survival games where you have a main shelter that you can build or improve, in Eternal Cylinder players develop a nomadic herd of unique alien creatures called Trebhums. Players control one Trebhum from the herd at a time and the rest follow (Al controlled) but players can switch to any individual member of their herd at will. Explore the world to rescue more of your brethren and continuously expand your family. Control a herd which can grow to more than 20 members at any given time and imbue each of your Trebhums with their own unique mutations and skill sets. Players can create a custom name for each of their Trebhum, increasing the emotional bond between player and their Trebhum family. * Unique Mutation System: Although Trebhum's are generally frail and start their lives at the very bottom of the world's food chain, they have the unique ability to mutate and unlock new skills by consuming natural edibles which populate the game world. So, players must explore and experiment with a vast array of fruits, flora and alien creatures to unlock new powers and gameplay options. * 50+ Mutations to discover: Players can unlock more than 50+ unique mutations as they explore the world, each one of which enable new gameplay options. These include new traversal options such as the ability to fly and swim, but also new offensive moves like the ability to spit fire and create loud warning noises. New mutations allow players to explore new areas and each mutation stacks thus creating a truly expansive skill set which is constantly evolving. * A Trebhum for everyone: Enjoy a virtually endless visual variety of Trebhum designs, as each mutation combine with one another to create surprising new creatures. This allows your herd to continue to evolve as players explore new areas and players can share the unique look of their Trebhum family with the rest of the world online. * Layered Survival: Players need to manage multiple layers of resources in order to be able to survive. These include hydration level, various temperatures each with their own impact and stamina. * Living and Breathing Ecosystems: The world of The Eternal Cylinder is populated with more than 30 memorable handcrafted alien creatures. These creatures vary greatly in size and range from those smaller than a Trebhum, all the way to skyscraper sized leviathans who dominate the horizon. Each of these creatures feature their own dedicated Al and behave in natural ways. Players must learn their unique behaviors and discover surprising ways to utilize the natural food chain to their advantage and interact with every creature. * Organic Puzzle Solving and Progression: The world of the Eternal Cylinder has been designed to empower players to organically solve its mysteries and progress without the need for obvious prompts and mission logs. This allows for fully immersive exploration which rewards players of every skill level, as the greater majority of the puzzles are not required for progression but do provide unique experiences. * 4 Unique Biodomes lo Discover ond Explore: Players can explore 4 unique biodomes including alien savannas and infected habitats, each with their own dedicated ecosystems and unique creatures to discover. * Truly Emergent Gameplay: The Eternal Cylinder's lush procedurally generated world, vast number of mutations to discover and unlock, unique creature Al system, living natural ecosystem, real-time world destruction and organically placed puzzles combine to create near endless possibilities for emergent gameplay and help to ensure that no two playthroughs will ever be there same.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/the-eternal-cylinder

It got minimal pixelated visuals, but rich gameplay and movie-like sound design. Its melancholic vibe reminded me of a recent game I played Inmost. I love Japan and its mythological history and folktales, and Olija seems to dive into that realm. I knew where I was getting myself into, when I saw some early gameplay footage of it; fast-paced action, lots of gore, lore and the odd, gloomy atmosphere. I played this fully on PS5 console. GAMEPLAY, CONTROLS, GRAPHICS, WEAPONS AND SOUND:The game starts strongly; with a shipwreck and a man Lord Faraday, who gets stuck into a mysterious place called Terraphage. I found other castaways, a legendary harpoon and an actual place, that I could build up as I went on a journey. Everytime I got back from caves and dungeons, the place was more full of survivors I rescued along the way. Olija is almost linear, mixed with some RPG elements, as I could buy health upgrades and craft various hats from materials, that gave extra protection or extra moves. I like the options and, obviously, I used all the help I could get. The game hides lots of secrets out of the boundary and I liked the satisfaction after trusting my guts and finding secret areas and items. With my main weapon, a legendary harpoon, I also got new alternative weapons, as I progressed in the game. Unfortunately, I found it tedious and slow to change the alt-weapons. The gameplay is fast-paced and my inputs always felt too slow. Also the controls could need some tweaking, for example, adding secondary button for the alt-weapon, to scroll them to opposite direction. Definitely these little details were the biggest problem in Olija, everything else was just so enjoyable. The detailed sound effects of enemies getting cut in pieces to enviromental audio was well-thought-out. What comes to the visuals and pixelated graphics. At times, I had to stand up and back away from my TV screen, to really see the whole picture clearly. It was rather diffcult to play on TV screen (55″), when so much was happening and all the pixels were so big. THE LAST WORDS:Olija is beautiful, enjoyable and rare game, but the controls might need some fine-tuning. I enjoyed those insane fight scenes, puzzles I had to solve, the storytelling and dungeon bosses. I’m sure every hack&slash gamers will enjoy this. I did too, and I don’t usually play this type of games. Olija is a great game, not too long, not too short, about 4 hours. I do recommend this, but if you still hesitate to buy it, there’s a free demo on Steam.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/olija

I also felt the game was easier but i can't tell if this is really the case, or if it is because of my experience with the first game?Overall, excellent game, despite a slower pace at the start, you really get into it afterwards.

The small-screen sprites are perfect, the 2-not-6 button workaround is implemented brilliantly, and the usual mechanics are all there: teching, 1 to 3 tag team, multiple fighting styles, etc. I didn't expect all this from a handheld game. Incidentally, it's kind of crazy that this is the first SvC (or MvC) game on the store... One big plus for this over other traditional fighting games is the AI difficulty scales all the way down to be beatable by the most novice of players. Only negatives:- The manual is a nice idea but only contains a fraction of the moves. (look them up on your phone like any other fighting game)- No save states (just a short rewind) means the randomness of unlocking characters might take me 1000 plays of the same story to get them all (can't reset to the start of the credits for another unlock attempt, as I did when I downloaded a rom to check this game out before buying).- Some slowdown at times. However they went above and beyond with dual emulation to allow split-screen 2 player and that's worked perfectly! Shame they don't have Card Fighters as well, as that used to have interactions with this game. It's cheap! It's good! Time will tell if people buying this game will convince the powers that be to port a REAL SvC or MvC, or that a new one is due!",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/snk-vs-capcom-match-of-the-millennium

See her skin, her eyes  her lips - this is way beyond npcs even in Alyx. And later in LE2 you will meet npcs that truly will knock your socks off (in case you're wearing any ;-) While Alyx is a lonely game with rare friendly social npc encounters, LE2 is like being in a real movie. This no longer feels like a game: I do not play Jack, I am Jack.The level of immersion provided in this game - and the story, is second to none. Sure, Alyx has much better performance, but Alyx does not have better graphics. Also in Alyx you only got hands, in LE2 you got a full body. Alyx never got under my skin, but LE2 does in spades. This is the new VR reference, 17/10 rating ;-) The game works perfectly with Revive. My rig: Asus Strix OC RTX 3090, 10900K and 32GB. I use both Rift CV1 and Valve Index. Rift CV1 works great using ss 2.0 and High settings, but you might have to lower ss to 1.7 to get solid 90 fps. Index works fine using same settings, but res 200%, in 80 Hz. Keep res as high as possible, deactivate 1) auto-res in-game and 2) reduction of objects in the periphery. Keep TAA on and do not activate MSAA for best image quality and performance. These guidelines are for users of RTX 3080 or better. Btw, this game is the epitome of CV1 gaming - blacks are awesome. If fact I don't mind using either CV1 ss 2.0 or Index res 200%, both are awesome. TAA is totally sharp using the Rift CV1. Even if the game does look good using lcd when forcing high res to reduce TAA blur, I believe the CV1 was the original design target for this game.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/lone-echo-ii

It plays like an old Impression city builder with some innovations that make the experience as unique as Casaer, Pharaoh, Zeus or Emperor: 1) Distribution system is a lot of fun. You have to balance each workplace with the ideal number of workers, specialists and haulers. There is no optimal template because each workplace has different conditions depending on how you plan your city. I've seen some reviewers call this system ""micromanage"" but it's simple and intuitive to use and makes the traffic plan of your city more impactful. 2) Custom monuments. The customization options are great and I hope they add more. Building your own monument is rewarding. You can build grand or small, but whatever you build will be a reflection of your city's wealth and prosperity. Or maybe you bankrupt yourself because your monumental visions are too grandiose for your impoverished city. Either way, the custom monument building is so immersive that I wish they included it in the Impressions games. 3) This game is challenging, though for a veteran of the Impressions games, I was ready for it. Taxes do not cover the cost of wages, (which makes sense, because how do you recieved more tax thank what you pay?) So you must always find other sources of income. I saw some reviewers complain about the difficulty. It is slightly harder than the Impressions games, so I would recommend you play the older games first. Nebuchadnezzar is more for ""advanced Isometric city builders"". Good game if you find other builders too easy.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/nebuchadnezzar

This is not the best ARPG, as Taiwanese are still on their way of modernizing, but the story is beautiful, the music makes you drop tears, and the gameplay is good, if not great. It is the story of a brother, a sister, and a childhood friend. Simple, pure, and beautiful. Interestingly, many Chinese don't like this story, because being educated in communist way, individual is nothing if he/she doesn't serve the ruler. They don't understand the right of one person is the right of whole nation. In the setting of this game, the early stage of Chinese civilization, not only people believe in personal freedom and importance of individuality, Taoism philosophers literally said ""Harming one person to benefit the whole nation, is totally unacceptable"". Xuan Yuan Sword 7 is a true heritage of Chinese Culture and its belief in love, freedom, and personal value, and it is great for anyone who's interested in something worthy but barely covered in other games.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/xuan-yuan-sword-7

Wystarczy obejrzeć kilka zwiastunów produkcji lub spędzić z nią tylko parę minut, aby zauważyć, że twórcy sięgnęli tutaj nie tylko po pewne elementy swojej wcześniejszej gry, ale również mocno czerpali inspirację z takiego hitu jak This War of Mine. Nie jest to jednak „klon”, któremu można byłoby zarzucić brak odtwórczości. Autorzy produkcji poszli o krok dalej, rozwijając mechanikę wspomnianego tytułu i tworząc tym samym produkcję, która ma naprawdę ogromny potencjał do tego, aby stać się równie mocno rozpoznawalną marką.Gracz przejmuje tutaj kontrolę nad grupką cywili (na początek zabawy dwójka bohaterów), którzy stali się mimowolnymi świadkami wojny. Muszą oni przetrwać kolejne dni w oblężonej twierdzy, z nadzieją wypatrując upragnionej odsieczy. Każda kolejna doba to masa wyzwań i niebezpieczeństw. Musimy tutaj zadbać nie tylko o podstawowe potrzeby kierowanych przez nas postaci, ale co ważniejsze mieć na uwadze regularne dostarczanie zapasów do obrońców zamku. To od nich bowiem zależy czy twierdza obroni się przed kolejnymi nieuchronnymi atakami wroga.Rozgrywka jest tutaj bardzo intuicyjna i nikt nie powinien mieć problemów z szybkim zrozumieniem mechaniki gry. Podobnie jak we wspomnianej produkcji (This War of Mine), mamy tutaj dwa etapy zabawy. W ciągu dnia zajmujemy się wykonywaniem różnorodnych czynności na dziedzińcu zamku. Stawiamy nowe użytkowe budowle, tworzymy potrzebne materiały/produkty, dbamy o mały zwierzęcy inwentarz, przetwarzamy niektóre z zebranych materiałów. Pracy jest bardzo dużo, a czas „dnia” bardzo ograniczony. W tym aspekcie gra pokazuje swój mocno „strategiczny” sznyt, który będzie na nas wymuszał bardzo rozsądne gospodarowanie posiadanymi zasobami. Gracz kilka razy dobrze się zastanowi czy przeznaczy np. drewno na wybudowanie nowego stołu rzemieślniczego, czy może porąbie go na kawałki, aby ugotować posiłek. Niektóre z takich decyzji mogą wydawać się trywialne, ale szybko idzie się przekonać o tym, że mogą one mieć ogromny wpływ na całą późniejszą rozgrywkę.Kiedy zapada zmrok, wyruszamy jedną z podległych postaci do oblężonego miasta w poszukiwaniu potrzebnych materiałów. Musimy tutaj uważać nie tylko na patrole wroga (co często wymusza powolne skradanie), ale cały czas mieć na uwadze mijający czas czy ograniczoną ilość miejsca w plecaku kierowanej przez nas postaci. Dostęp do konkretnych dzielnic czy przeszukanie niektórych rumowisk wymaga od nas posiadania konkretnych narzędzi (łopata/pochodnia/klucz), które nie tylko zajmują miejsce w plecaku, ale pierwsze trzeba je wykonać lub odnaleźć. Podczas przeszukiwania miejscówek możemy również natknąć się na specjalne „wydarzenia” (opisane w formie paragrafowych opowieści) pozwalające na zdobycie niektórych cennych materiałów czy uratowanie cywila, który może dołączyć do naszej „drużyny” (w sumie można kierować maksymalnie czterema postaciami). Każde z takich specjalnych „wydarzeń” wymusza na nas podjęcie istotnych decyzji, których konsekwencje mogą być naprawdę różne.Twórcy postarali się o to, aby przed graczem pojawiło się naprawdę sporo różnorodnych wydarzeń, w których będziemy podejmowali trudne i istotne decyzje. To od gracza będzie zależeć czy np. będzie chciał wywarzyć zamknięte drzwi, czy przekopać rumowisko w poszukiwaniu cennych towarów tym samym marnując czas i ryzykując zaalarmowanie przeciwnika nadmiernym hałasem. Co  jeśli nie znajdzie się tam nic cennego lub jest to pułapka? Na dodatek niektóre miejscówki są dostępne tylko dla konkretnych postaci (np. mających większą siłę, ale mniejszy plecak). Każda wieczorna eskapada musi więc być dobrze przemyślana. Kto pójdzie do miasta, kto będzie śledził poczynienia wroga, a kto odpoczywał. Nie obejdzie się również bez decyzji nacechowanych sporymi emocjami. Pomożesz obcemu atakowanemu przez wroga samemu się narażając? Przygarniesz go do swojej „bazy”, pomniejszając tym samym i tak szczupłe zasoby leków czy jedzenia? Komu pomóc, kogo zostawić na pastwę losu lub doprowadzić do jego śmierci?Jedyne czego mi tutaj zabrakło do pełni szczęścia to chociaż krótkiego opisu historii kierowanych przez nas bohaterów. Dzięki czemu gracz mógłby się z nimi o wiele bardziej „zżyć” i mocniej odczuć ich ewentualną stratę.Cały tekst:https://popkulturowykociolek.pl/recenzja-gry-siege-survival-gloria-victis/",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/siege-survival-gloria-victis

Daher habe ich es auch direkt am Release-Tag 26. Jan. 2021 gekauft. Nachfolgend möchte ich meine Eindrücke zu dem Spiel festhalten. Die Geschichte:Die Spieler tauchen in ein Science-Fiction Story ein, die im Jahr 2062 spielt. Wir begleiten das neunjährige Mädchen Tina und ihren “Kindermädchen-Roboter” SAM durch ihr Abenteuer. Beide leben am Rande der Gesellschaft in der Mega-Großstadt Neo-Berlin. Dieses neue Berlin ist noch multikultureller als unser heutiges Berlin. Nach einem Krieg haben sich dort die asiatischen Einflüsse und Spuren sichtlich erhöht, da Europa und Asien sozusagen zusammengewachsen sind. Für Tina geht es nicht nur darum in diesem Großstadtdschungel zu überleben, sondern auch herauszufinden was mit ihren Eltern passiert ist und warum Tina, mit der Hilfe von SAM, auf sich allein gestellt ist. In Neo-Berlin haben die virtuelle Realität und der Cyberspace eine größere Bedeutung gewonnen als das reale Leben. Was hat Encodya mit all dem zu tun und was ist das für ein Ort? Die Geschichte wird in fünf Kapiteln erzählt und wirft tiefgreifende Sinnfragen auf. Nämlich was ist real und was ist in unserer Realität wichtig? Welche Bedeutung hat die Familie und insgesamt die zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen, oder sogar die Beziehung zu einem Roboter. Die Grafik:Mir gefällt der Grafikstil sehr gut. Ein Kompliment an die Künstler und Grafiker die dahinterstehen. Ich empfand ENCODYA optisch sehr ansprechend und wirklich hübsch gestaltet. Wenn man unbedingt nach Fehlern suchen möchte, könnten Perfektionisten feststellen, dass die Figuren schon mal Probleme haben Wege aneinander vorbei zu finden und manchmal eine Figur durch eine andere hindurch läuft. Mich hat das nicht so sehr gestört, da ich mich gut auf die schönen Aspekte konzentrieren konnte. Was noch eine zusätzliche und ganz witzige Idee ist, man kann in dem Spiel ein Objekt einsammeln, mit dem man zu einem Vintage-Look wechseln kann. Damit kann man also zu einem Pixel-Look wechseln, wenn man das denn gerne möchte. Mich erinnert das z.B. an ""Day of the Tentacle Remastered"" bei dem man ebenfalls zwischen Pixel-Look und hochauflösender Grafik switchen kann. Ich bin immer wieder mal zum Vintage-Look gewechselt, muss aber sagen, dass mir hier der ""Original-Look"" besser gefällt. Sprachausgabe und Musik:Die englische Sprachausgabe ist gut und die Stimmen passen gut zu den Charakteren. Für deutschsprachige Adventure-Fans wäre eine gute deutsche Sprachausgabe sicher nochmal eine Aufwertung, aber man kann sich zur Not mit den deutschen Untertiteln arrangieren. Die Musik ist angenehm und gut zusammengestellt. Sie passt immer gut zum jeweiligen Spielabschnitt. Die Rätsel:Man bekommt sehr klassische Adventure-Rätsel und Aufgaben angeboten. Gegenstände einsammeln und kombinieren, Dialoge führen, Botengänge erledigen, oder eine Leistung für eine Gegenleistung erhalten. Die Rätsel und Aufgaben sind in sich schlüssig und logisch und driften niemals zu sehr ins Skurrile oder nicht mehr Nachvollziehbare ab. Zu Beginn des Spiels kann man zwischen zwei Schwierigkeitsgraden wählen. Ich hatte mich für die schwere Variante entschieden. In dieser Variante muss man ohne Hotspot-Anzeige und Hilfefunktion auskommen. Einiges meiner Spielzeit entfällt daher auf das akribische Absuchen von Screens und dem Entdecken relevanter Objekte. Spieler die dafür keine Geduld haben, oder für die das Adventure-Genre neu ist, würde ich daher die leichte Variante empfehlen. Der Support:Ich möchte hier lobend den Support erwähnen, der sehr schnell auf meinen Forums-Eintrag reagiert hat und mir eine passende Lösung zur Verfügung gestellt hat. Im Kapitel 5 kann es ggf. zu einem Absturz kommen, wenn man einen Screen nach rechts hin verlassen möchte. Ich konnte den Absturz dadurch verhindern, dass ich die beiden “.abc-Dateien” in meinem Installationsordner unter ENCODYA_Data/StreamingAssets gelöscht hatte. Fan-Fiktion:Es wäre genial, wenn ähnlich wie bei “Beyond a Steel Sky” zu ENCODYA noch eine deutsche Sprachausgabe und Sammelkarten nachgeliefert würden. Ich würde mich jedenfalls über weitere Adventures von Chaosmonger Studio und Assemble Entertainment freuen. Fazit:Eine Kaufempfehlung für alle Point & Click Adventure Freunde und diejenigen, die es noch werden wollen. Bewertung: 85 % Wenn eine deutsche Sprachausgabe und Sammelkarten vorhanden wären und zudem noch kleine Schönheitsfehler beseitigt würden, dann hätte ich eine Bewertung jenseits der 90% gegeben. [link omitted per site rules]",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/encodya

Graphics, story, and gameplay are much better than most jrpg games. It feels like a game made by a top publisher, rivaling many of the well known long-running jrpg series, even though it was mostly made by a team of nine people. It's an indie development, so it's not as polished as a AAA title, but it's a really good investment for the price, taking me more time to complete just the first few chapters than it took to completely beat FF7 remake. The combat is turn-based and uses enemy weaknesses, a grid system, and items on the map to help you or hurt you in battle. There is an in-depth gathering/crafting system and a lot of sidequests, some of which have a story attached to them. I usually stay far away from puzzles, but the puzzles in this game (almost all optional) are actually really fun. The crystal system to upgrade your skills and stats is unique, and sort of a mix between the FF13-2 upgrade tree and FF7 materia. Lots of customization potential, and several combat difficulty levels to chose from. Really great music, some of it by well-known composer Yasunori Mitsuda. The story is very engaging, I was surprised at the high quality of story writing and voice acting. It's so rare to come across a really well done story. A lot of it is quite funny, but there are serious aspects as well. I was barely holding back tears at one point. Some of the characters are all-time favorites for me now. Overall, this game has a lot of depth and replay value. You can beat it in 30-50 hours, but I've currently played for 190 hours.

It tries to go both ways and as a result, gets nowhere. Yet, it is still charming in a few ways and a few of the gameplay elements are fun and engaging. So why the negative rating? Technical issues and lack of polish. First of, the graphics and the design - the game has a Minecraft+ style, blocky but some detail, and as mentioned, it is pretty charming. Unfortunately, the quality is kinda all over the place. You have locations that are well designed and with a lot of attention to detail, and then you just have other locations that are mostly empty, or they look hastily thrown together. Some of the parts of the game are also in a hand drawn (I guess?) 2D - and it has a very high quality and looks good. It just doesn't really fit for me, it's very out of place for the overall style. Sound is okay, the music is okay, a bit bland and generic ""casual game"" style. Same goes for the ambience. It's good enough, but it's nothing memorable. Story wise, it's a slice of life story with some play at emotions. I have seen it praised, but I honestly found it to be a bit bland. It tries to go for the feels way too soon, before I was even immersed into the world, it was already ""feel-sad-baiting"". The lore of the game, or rather the locations where it takes place, is pretty funny and interesting, though. Also, the narrative has a mild case of ""the woke"". The gameplay, as mentioned at the beginning, is kinda all over the place. The fishing is pretty interesting and fun at first, but there's a completely unnecessary mechanic that allows you to cheese through it. You can of course decide not to use it, but the fact that it even is in the game the way it is makes me question how much playtesting was done. I have a feeling it wasn't much. The cooking is also pretty fun, and it has no exploits as far as I know, but the QTEs that are part of it have pretty inaccurate button push/release registration and as the resulting food quality depends on how precisely you do the QTEs, you sometimes get screwed over. Finally, there's the business part and the economy. The business part is undercooked, literally. You cook a batch of food, and put it out to sell. But you don't really see how much of what you are selling, etc. Daily, one food gets a bonus, and one a negative status, increasing / decreasing price, but since you don't know how much stuff is left, and which types are sold out or not, you don't know what effect it has on you. You also can't take foods that are already being sold out of the stock and return them once their price increases. There is also no real simulation of demand besides these random statuses, so you can literally spam one type of food - the easiest to make that you can make out of all / most of the fish you catch, and just cheese it this way. For some recipes - most actually, you will also need different ingredients. You have unlimited amount of them in your kitchen, but you pay for them when you take them out of your fridge. And my question is, why even have this in? Like, just stop at the point where ""you have unlimited other ingredients"", remove the paying for them, and reduce the sell price of the foods. It's also not balanced well, and it's literally just more profitable to spam some cheaper foods instead - not to mention that you are supposed to have a fast food stall, and most of the stuff you cook is anything but fastfood, and a lot of fastfood recipes are not available. Also, the way fish works is stupid - you get fish, they have weight, etc. - but it does not matter - 1 fish = 1 meal. If the game was trying to stay casual, alright, fine, but it's trying to do this business thing, and it makes no sense. A 40kg fish, allows you to make one batch of fish cakes. So does a 4kg one... How is that even a thing? You can also donate fish to local aquarium, and it boosts your sale price - supposedly, I actually didn't see any change, and also, once when I donated fish, the aquarium only accepted some (all were new species), and not the rest - but they still got taken out of my inventory, so I had to donate another specimens of those species... Furthermore, there's a bunch of issues with random invisible walls, or places where the ground ends before the hitbox so you float above sea with your character in the parts where you are not on your boat, and so on. It just feels hastily thrown together - someone had a cool idea, but not enough patience - or skil, or both - to pull it off. And it's a damn shame, because the premise of the game is really fun, hell some of it is already here - fishing without the quickreeling, some aspects of the cooking, the long list of different and fairly distinct species of fish and other sea creatures... It just isn't done well.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/moonglow-bay

Main reasons for me are :-	All the glitches that I would personally be irritated by, were fixed. Such as the erratic “jump” the car was making before it would get to the start line, or some “missing text” glitch on the reports you got after an event, or those horrendous water splashes showing up before the car would actually touch the water, or in my case being stuck in WRC 2 forever despite performing all the recommended actions and being WRC2 champ multiple times (heard that it was a bug very early on). The most important one is that the Argentina stages are now all playable with a perfectly constant 30 fps.-	There is now depth of field in WRC 9. This might not seem like a big deal, but during replays it is like night and day with respect to the overall looks of the game. Especially on Switch where the surroundings are far from being detailed, with low resolution, etc. It really adds a lot to the aesthetics, by “hiding” some of the not-so-pretty assets.-	A photo mode!!!! I just love photo mode in videogames. This one is pretty nice, all the features you’d expect are there. You even have a showcase mode from the main menu, where you can select the car, weather, etc. and use photo mode. I attached a couple screenshots so you can get an idea of what’s possible.-	Some classic cars are available, such as the Corolla (available through DLC), Xsara, and Focus. The Corolla is one of my favorite WRC cars ever, so very happy with that!!!-	I might be wrong on this one, but I think lighting has been improved. So if you add all that to an already very good game, you simply get the ultimate WRC experience, the best rally game ever released on a handheld, period. Lots of features, topnotch gameplay, nice presentation for the Switch, it’s a 9/10 for me. Only complaint is how some shadows are handled on some stages, as they drawn right in front of the car, literally.

These journalists keep comparing indie games with AAA games, expecting a low budget game to be like Red Dead Redemption 2. Journos have lost it, that is why I do not buy a game based on reviews, I go and watch gameplay and if I like it, I grab it.Do not fall into the stupid cycle of reading a review and thinking because a journo said the game is bad, then it is bad… this is an incredible Shinobi/Ninja experience. DO NOT MISS IT! SETTINGI am a Shinobi/Ninja aficionado… Ghost of Tsushima, Sekiro, Shinobi, Ninja Gaiden… you name it. This game has interesting mechanics, and it allows the player how to approach your opponents. I will be comparing this game with other Shinobi/Ninja games, so you get my meaning… if you have not played those games before, go and watch gameplay videos in youtube to understand what I mean.The game is not a direct continuation of the original, but rather like a side story… as an Aragami you are an agent of shadows and need to protect your home from an evil empire. Simple enough and as like with the first game, it suffices… these games are all about the gameplay, not story. MECHANICS•	Stealth:Core base mechanic is stealth, and if you have played stealth games before you know what this means: hiding all the time, either in rooftops, grass, covering behind walls… stalking your enemies and awaiting the perfect opportunity to launch a devastating attack and put their miserable lives down!Many stealth games have repeated the same approach and there is something compelling about these types of games that keeps attracting players. Aragami 2 is faster than its predecessor and offers a very nice approach to stalk your enemies… crouch, double jump, slide, air-slide, hang onto ledges… and position yourself strategically to deliver your death blow… it is so satisfying, it never gets boring, it is cool! You will enjoy it… it is different than Sekiro’s and Ghost of Tsushima’s stealth killing mechanics, but it is indeed well done. •	Combat:This is a new mechanic vs the original Aragami. You decide if you want to battle enemies, but they will surround you and you will die, a lot!If you are discovered you can still run away, try to hide, and wait for the enemies to calm down to go back into stealth mode again… as it happens with other games of the genre.Combat is relatively simple but to master it, it will take some time as enemies move slow, fast, they can slide, they can jump… it is not easy, and a few hits and you are done. Pressing the parry button at the right time is not simple, and as there is a stamina gauge you cannot just take a parry stance all the time as enemies will break your stance if you are not aggressive as well.You need to dash back (which consume stamina as well!) and prepare strategically your approach, but seriously, you will die a lot in this game if you decide to go bravado on the enemies or if you fail to conceal yourself. This is NOT bad, but it can be frustrating (I mean, how many times did you die playing Sekiro, eh? Still awesome, right?) •	ExplorationWhilst you sneak around, take your time to seek for coins. It is a good approach as you explore around sneaking and slaying foes. Not too much to add, but you just do not go around killing. Scenarios will open new areas as your progress in the missions, so there is plenty to explore and sneak about! VISUALSAs with the first game, the visuals are a la Zelda Wind Waker, like cell shades with HD resolution. It looks great, and I do not expect fully animated voice characters from a small company as Lince Works. However, let me tell you that the assassination visuals are incredible: running, crouching, jumping, hanging, etc, feels natural. The game looks and feels fine. SOUNDAmbient music with the occasional Asian instrument in the background makes it for a nice approach in your stealth missions. Get discovered and the music will change. As with the original game, the music is good and you will get accustomed to it, it does not get boring FINAL VERDICT:My final Verdict is a solid 9.0 for the game.This game looks and feels good, it is not a AAA game with amazing animations, cutscenes like a Hollywood blockbuster, or an Orchestrated soundtrack. I do not need games like that all the time, this is an amazing adventure, thank you Lince Works!And you, gamer, do not heed stupid reviews like the one in IGN.

It may not be for everyone as some may find it too much of a grind at times and it can feel like you're a little underpowered in the beginning but some investment in the skill tree can really make up the difference. The text suffers from being a lazy port in that it's too small. Fine if you're on PC inches away from the screen but on a sofa a few meters away and it's difficult to make out a lot of the ship names sailing by or locations on the map. I have had a few crashes here and there and while annoying, you never lose much progress thanks to autosave every time you enter or exit a port. Hopefully, this will be fixed in the near future. The combat is simple and fun. You get to make use of the RPG element of the game by selecting equipment that suits you as well a four unique powers that range from sending a shark to attack the enemy ship, to becoming ethereal for a few seconds to increase speed and become immune to all damage. The game does well at offering new mechanics hours after the start to keep things fresh but it sometimes fails to explain certain things, especially when trying to determine your ship's stats on the inventory screen. Sometimes, items might show as a green increase to damage, for example, but it calculates critical chance into the power stat. At one point, at a glance, it looked like I had a cannon power level of 10k but in reality, it was about half that, so you have to be careful when equipping new gear that looks like it's an improvement. I recommend this game and for the price, you'll get your money's worth.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/king-of-seas

While Career Mode isn’t technically the first thing that you need to do in this game, it’s most likely where you’ll be spending the most of your time earning your grips on the newest installment. Like with any racing game’s Career Mode, the objective is to motor out on the track in hopes of winning fame and of course rewards. Career Mode itself is divided into three different categories (Futures, Rookie, and Pro) with each sporting tougher competition; more races; the possibility for better rewards. While it’s nice that the basics are there, what really impressed me was that the devs really seemed to go out of the way to put in as many extras as possible. Rather than just throwing the player into multiple races back-to-back, you’re brought to a hub menu in between races. It’s here that you’re not only able to do the basics like look at player stats and perform maintenance on your motor bike a number of different mini-games await. While difficult, performing well in these mini-games nets you points that you can use on what this game has literally dubbed as a skill tree. Additionally, should you manage to impress the crowd during a race then you’ll occasionally be invited to special events where you’re challenged with performing various objectives on the track in order to win larger rewards. When it comes to actual racing Monster Energy Supercross 4 seems to be very particular about how its players handles the game. The drifting techniques that you picked up in many a range series come in handy here, but that’s just the beginning of things. In order to come out on top or for my sake, to just not come in last place then you’ve got to know supercross basics well. This, of course, means things like weight distribution, bike setup, acceleration technique, the proper way to jump, and so on. When it comes to the bare-bones basics of supercross, Monster Energy Supercross 4 doesn’t really tell you anything but I’m sure you’re likely no stranger to the series if you’re reading this. You’re expected to know it already, or go in and learn it. However, once you’re comfortable, this game is actually quite accommodating. There’s a myriad of options available to help players tweak the game settings to their liking. From the ability to have your character auto-adjust to the “Dynamic Flow” option which literally has giant blue arrows telling you how to optimally make your jumps and this game in the series may not be all that friendly in terms of welcoming you into the fold, but as in previous games in the series, once you’re in. The game is plenty accommodating. Things are, admittedly, a little less exciting when examining the courses themselves. This isn’t really anything to be upset about, though. Because M emulates a more realistic style of racing and the courses are also created in a realistic way to learn the ropes. If you’re into supercross, or genuinely appreciate realism, this shouldn’t be an issue at all. However, if you like your racing courses a little more crazy then this may not be your cup of tea as realism is on par for today’s courses. You’ve got usuals, of course, with things like Time Attack and Championship modes, but, once again (because I totally did this in the preview, too), I’d like to focus on a few of my favorites, the first being the Trac Editor and  while I can’t play all racing games out there, track editors really aren’t something that I see too often. And, while I personally can’t claim that I’m all too great at creating courses, it was fun being able to mess around on courses that other people made and play with fresh ideas abound. My favorite mode is the Compound which is a wide-open space featuring various mini-games and even a smattering of hidden collectibles, the Compound was probably one of my favorite things to play in the game this season since it gives you plenty of time to practice. Monster Energy Supercross 4 wants you to figure out its finer points, the Compound is a great place to freely practice. On a less important note, it also provides a nice change of pace from the arenas that you’re constantly biking around in. When it comes down to it,Monster Energy Supercross The Official VideoGame 4 is absolutely a game for previous fans of the franchise. So long as you already know about the sport, you probably won’t have too much of an issue jumping right into things, and I’m sure that you’ll enjoy all that the game has to offer. Those who may not know anything about supercross might want to watch out. While things are nice and friendly once you understand the basics, you’re in for a pretty rough start if you’re coming in completely new. If you are indeed a fan of the franchise then head on over to the Xbox digital games store and download the newest the franchise has on offer for you.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/monster-energy-supercross---the-official-videogame-4

The same phrase used by ID software to explain the combat philosophy of Doom 2016 which results in frantic, nail biting, free flowing combat. It is not that Curved Space was designed to mimic Doom, however good design decisions and good combat often share characteristics in common. Yes the name and the gimmick behind Curved Space, make a big deal out of the technology that enables acrobatic maneuvering and shooting over curved surfaces. Yes the Campaign has multiple paths and expertly voiced dialogue. Yes the weapons are many and awesome and absurdly unique. Yes there is an energy lash that lets you siphon energy from your enemies and energy nodes alike. But that is just where the game starts, that is just how the game pulls you in and shows you its wares. The game really comes alive and starts to shine once you get past all of that and start to dig deeper into the nuanced combat system. Curved Surfaces translate to free flowing navigation and multiple avenues of scape and attack when you are in the thick of battle, multiple weapons translate to choosing your own gameplay style and just as many upgrades translate to, optimizing that play style for maximum efficacy. The lash and the dash however are what will keep you alive, they are the way you ram enemies for insta-kills and extra health refills, and absurd amounts of points on chained combos. Let me tell you: A billion points is possible in this game, perhaps even a trillion, but it will take every ounce of concentration and optimization on your part to claim that victory in the game's public scoreboards. Come play the game, learn the basic combat through the Campaign, hone your skills in the Arenas, and come prove what you are made of in Survival, Endless and Daily Modes. Perhaps one day you will be able to finish the Campaign in Nightmare with all of the modifiers that make the game even harder, including the 'No Continues"" (Permadeath) option turned on! But don't think this is only for the ultra hardcore audience, there is a casual mode as well as 5 more levels of difficulty for everyone in between to have fun and leave their mark on the corresponding score board or to collect their platform's achievements. Pick up the game and go as deep as you'd like, you will have fun!

While this is an apt summary of Rustler, it also doesn't do justice to quite an entertaining and compact experience. Rustler's graphics hark back to the old-school GTAs with a birds-eye view. This allows for graphics to be less detailed in-line with the lower budget the game had and it works really well. One disadvantage of GTA was that you struggled to see where you were going, but Rustler circumvents this by having you on horseback, with most horses and traversal covering a fairly short distance. You will see framerate drops and imperfections, but really the graphics fulfil their purpose. The graphics are far from a PS5 standard, but the price of the game also reflects this and I think that's perfectly fine. The gameplay of Rustler borrows from GTA and borrows very well. The horses can be tricky to handle and this is likely to be the most common issue you experience, but at the same time this is also a skill to be learned. You won't have guns but you do have an array of blades and bows to handle. The combat isn't ground-breaking but also easy to learn quickly. The missions and Rustler as a whole tends to be short and snappy, which really works in favour of the game to prevent repetition and padding. The main quest and side quests provide just enough content that I was neither unsatisfied or over-saturated by the game's end. Some of the quests can get a bit fiddly, such as jousting which seemed a tad inaccurate, as well as a specific mission involving collecting bodies which had an insanely narrow time-limit. These are something that can be overcome with a bit of practice but do cause mild frustration. The story of Rustler is really where it shines. Humour in game like this can often reach immature and toilet-level of intellect, but Rustler manages to toe the line between crude insolence and clever barbs. There are plenty of references such as Monty Python and a general attitude of not taking life too seriously. I don't want to spoil the game, so I'll just say that there's a bard-core version of Queen's ""I want to Break Free"" that was a real highlight of the game for me. Despite the humour there is a coherent narrative and direction to the game centred on a kind of revenge plot that I found surprisingly engrossing also. Overall, Rustler is a game that hasn't attracted the attention it deserves. I found it to be a concise, humorous and enjoyable experience that I can wholly recommend. It may not be a next-gen paradigm shift, but it never sets out to be and makes no airs or graces at deriving inspiration from classic GTA. This is well worth a try.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-5/rustler

Sulla scia nostalgica dei classici giochi rompicampo, Seed of Life offre attraverso un’avventura dinamica in terza persona un mondo alla deriva e quasi disintegrato dal caos e da un’invasione aliena che ne minaccia la completa estinzione. La storia non è sicuramente delle più brillanti ed originali, soprattutto a causa di una recitazione non troppo ispirata e spesso e volentieri forzata ed innaturale. Alcuni difetti nella programmazione non rendono fruibile l’opera, chiaramente un prodotto acerbo che tuttavia nasconde anche delle perle di inestimabile valore.Seed of Life è un titolo che basa il gameplay interamente sulla presenza di rompicapi ed enigmi ambientali. Il mondo di gioco, tuttavia, rappresenta alcune caratteristiche di un open world, con enormi possibilità (sempre nei limiti imposti dal genere principale) di girovagare per la mappa. Questo, in realtà, rappresenta uno dei più grandi difetti della produzione, poiché la realizzazione della mappa è piuttosto confusionaria e il giocatore spesso si ritroverà smarrito e dubbioso sulla possibilità o meno di percorrere un’area che si rivelerà essere poi, difatti, inaccessibile. Un mondo esplorabile di dimensioni più contenute, dunque, avrebbe secondo noi elevato la qualità del titolo. Il livello di dettaglio della natura e delle costruzioni che troveremo sul nostro cammino sarà sorprendente. Sebbene ci si trovi dinnanzi un titolo “indie”, l’immersione tecnica degli ambienti non ha davvero nulla da invidiare a produzioni ben più blasonate. Il tutto, però, viene spesso rovinato da continui glitch inerenti il movimento del personaggio su schermo: compenetrazioni poligonali, scatti improvvisi, repentini cali di framerate, ed azioni (come quella del salto) per niente calibrate.Gli enigmi sono piuttosto semplificati, restituendo un livello di sfida non troppo convincente: dopo le prime ore di gioco si capirà il meccanismo dietro ognuno di questi. Alcuni bug (come per esempio quello di apertura delle porte magiche) ci costringeranno a tornare al più vicino checkpoint per ricaricarci del Lumium e così riprovare, e solo per via di una cattiva gestione del codice.Si tratta di errori grossolani che vanno irreparabilmente a cozzare col ritmo di gioco e con lo stile tanto curato e delineato della grafica, restituendo un’esperienza deficitaria e un po’ deludente.La componente platforming, presente soprattutto nel passaggio da un’area all’altra, è un’aggiunta forse troppo frettolosa resa inutilizzabile dalla pessima gestione della telecamera. Anche il fattore tempo va a decostruire le buone intenzioni del titolo, poiché sarà presente per alcuni rompicapi rendendo difatti ansiogena e poco lucida la risoluzione degli stessi. In sintesi, gli sviluppatori si sarebbero dovuto focalizzare di più sulla componente rompicapo lasciando ad altri tipologie di gioco l’esplorazione e il platforming. L’unione di più stili è in questi casi un punto di debolezza piuttosto che un punto di forza. Un vero peccato, date le premesse.La realizzazione più squisitamente estetica del titolo è forse il suo più grande vanto e, per estensione, pregio. Gli ambienti, curati nel minimo dettaglio, fanno solo da sfondo ad un sapientissimo utilizzo di luci e colori. Gli scenari, sempre piuttosto diversificati e resi unici da eventi in-game, cattureranno spesso l’occhio del giocatore. Apprezzabile l’intento di doppiare interamente (o quasi) le scene del gioco, sebbene spesso e volentieri il voice actor di Cora utilizzi un tono piuttosto neutro, quasi robotico, che difficilmente riuscirà a rimandare emozioni forti come quelle che vivrà in tutto il viaggio. La narrazione scorrerà però fluida, spesso accompagnata da alcune musiche figlie di una colonna sonora poco ispirata, ma per nulla trascurata. Da un lato si evincono chiaramente gli intenti e l’impegno degli sviluppatori nel voler ricreare un titolo dall’atmosfera post apocalittica, ma dall’altro si denota comunque una trascuratezza sicuramente frutto della natura stessa del titolo che comunque resta godibile per gli appassionati del genere.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/seed-of-life-2021

A disappointing FPS hampered by bugs. I really had high hopes for this game. Necromunda: HR is a fast paced frantic FPS in the style of Doom and that's what hooked me. A Doom style game set in 40K? Yes yes yes.There is wall running, double jumping, and even a grappling hook. The set pieces are intricately designed with the lore in mind and there is so much to look at the game nails almost all of it. The narrative is hardly original, you are a bounty hunter betrayed on the first mission and looking for revenge. But hardly anyone plays shooters for the story. When it comes to gameplay the game throws endless waves of enemies at you as you progress through levels. Levels can range from small sewer's to huge open spaces. There are tons of nooks and crannies to explore and the devs have hidden loot chests and pick ups all over the maps. Problem is, sometimes the HUD does not give good indication of where you need to go. There are four catagories of guns (pistol, special, heavy, and basic) all of which can be customized and two catagories of special trait items that effect stats. And that is where we come to some of the games glaring issues. For a supposed ""looter"" the loot menu and loadout screen is horrendously bad. There is little in the way of information on how special items work and most seem inconsequential. It feels like the loot system was thrown in with little planning or thought because it feels so shallow. There are some bugs as of right now (camera movement, clipping through walls during takedowns, the gun not shooting). Wall running is different in HR than in Titanfall. Instead of just automatically happening like in Titanfall you have to hold down A (which is also the jump button). You can see the issue when pressing A twice does a double jump. It makes wall running frustrating and honestly I use it very little unless forced to. I am sure they will be patched soon and when they do I will come back and update my review.  At this point I cannot recommend this game on XBSX until it is patched. Once it has been there is great potential for it to be a fun mindless shooter.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/necromunda-hired-gun

I just hope going forward there more effort in makin animal species more accurate as this is again supposed to be animal documentary styled.. and this is not what a bird eating spider looks like.. as just one example where the team goes eh close enough, we don’t have time to model in a new species.. you do though, this is the most important part of emersing me into an experience like this.. and obviously more polish..Im fine with the sequel being half this size if we don’t get a second half that falls apart again..Overall AWAY the survival series is underrated and worth checking out for story, animal,and platforming lovers..I giveAWAY: The Survival Seriesa 7/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/away-the-survival-series
