The game is very polished, and runs incredibly well even on very low powered hardware. Movement is fluid and fast, and the shooting is satsfying. Heroes are really distinct and have their own personality and gameplay. No hero plays the same like another.  Also, since i have seen this online lately, disregard anyone who complains about hero balance and about cheesy tactics that are somehow ""unbeatable"". This is clearly a ""learn to play"" issue. I played the Beta a lot, and let me tell you, that balance is in a very good place, though could be improved even more. Everything has its counters. While this game has only 12 maps right now, and it is repetitive, it manages to stay fun and interesting for a surprisingly long time. The main reason for this is that the game has immense depth under the casual-friendly appearence, it is one of those easy to learn but very hard to master games. There is always something new to try and learn. And the competitive aspect of the game will keep you coming for more. The main downside of this game, is that if you have no friends to play with, you won't get nearly the same satisfaction with those who do have their own party. This game is heavily based around teamwork and tactics. You can still find success solo, of course, but will be more difficult. Other than that, the game deserves its price.

Seems people are reporting an average of 40-60 hour play times if that is of interest though. So far it's great. As many people have already said, the design is where it shines. The game never tells you what or how to do anything. You begin pushing and rolling sausages to fully cook them around and while it seems like a simple premise, you are constantly learning new things and playing the game in a much different way than you were before so it never feels repetitive. Often I get stuck and then realize, ""Oh wow I can do that?"" While being designed in a way where I naturally stumbled upon it by trying things that seemed possible. I have never thought, ""Oh how was I suppose to think of that?"" You can undo every move you make too so trying new things is encouraged. But don't be fooled by its funny name or silly premise. This is one of the hardest puzzle games out there. Think of something like Snakebird, another extremely hard game that looks all cute and innocent on the outside. Of course I still have much to do so it's just going to get even more difficult. I can see why Jonathan Blow (Braid/The Witness) has cited this game as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Alexander Bruce (Antichamber) has given the game high praise as well. The developer Increpare has created English Country Tune and a multitude of other small little games. Games I would also recommend checking out. He's mostly known among devs and people who actually watch out for these lesser known games.

This makes for some great support conversations, more customization, and it helps expand the long term value of the game by a lot. While most reviewers agree that Revelation stands in the middle ground when it comes to difficulty, I have to disagree. I think Revelation might just be the easiest of three, for the most part, not entirely. I'd say for newcomers, hard difficulty might be a pretty viable option. For hardcore players, I'd say lunatic on your first run might pretty doable, more than Birthright, and definitely more than Conquest. It may not offer a story as epic as Conquest, but it does present us with its unique take on the story, more characterization, new villains, and some pretty impressive twists. My only negative would be that by the end of the game, the maps start becoming a bit repetitive, but that's about it. The censoring of the game did bother me, but I'm not about to dock off points unfairly for such a great game. TL;DR If you liked Conquest or Birthright, go buy this one.

I want to touch up on the graphics a bit; simply put, this is one the most beautiful games I have ever played. On par with the games made with the Ubi Art engine (Rayman Legends, Child of Light), the style breaths life into the game. Backgrounds and platforms are beautifully hand drawn and shaded in a vector / watercolor style. Character models are drawn similarly, but with an extra dimension added to make them come alive. The game performs very well, with little slowdowns. Unfortunately it is not locked at 60 frames per second, as I encountered a few frame rate drops here and there during hectic sequences, but nothing that detracted from my experience. For $20 bucks and a 6-12 hour story with plenty of replayability, buy this game. It is a masterpiece, and any gamer will be doing themselves a disservice by not giving it a try.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/shantae-half-genie-hero

This game/Visual Novel is the sequel/mid-quel of the 1st one, and is practically the explanation and process of how the D-mail Okabe received after falling to rescue Kurisu the 1st time. Compare to the original one, this game is amazingly well-made, following suite with the emotion of the MC, full of regret and sadness. The game introduce a new aspect beside time travel: a program which stores and develops the owner's memories on its own, like a true human put inside a monitor. And surprisingly the concept merges so well with the time travelling, giving a fresh air for the series. And thus, it's the main root of many problem, despairs, and the dark side of the game. The jokes, happy events and heart-warming moment are still there, but they won't last long, and the reality after that will hit you hard... So just, brace yourself in advance when it happens. The game length, in my opinion, is fairly shorter than the previous, but it's more painful, heart-broken, and frustrated, since the MC had already given up on Kurisu after all. Also, in order to reach the true end, you have to play the game once, then start again/ reload the crucial moment. The fact that there are less options to guide the story, or interact with other characters will probably annoy some players, but I think it is a good thing, since you can focus more on the story, without sidetracking to other diversions. Overall, there are lots of shortcoming from this game, and the true end leaves much to be desired (since you already know what will happen after it in the original one). However, I love it. Manly tears have been shred, and I enjoy the journey far more than I expected. If you have already experienced Steins;Gate, then I'd 100% recommend you to play this. It's worth your time (and probably your tears as well). And lastly, I wish you well with Operation Skuld, my fellow mad scientist. El. Psy.

I've played many of the telltale-esque games out there and I have to say, this game's story and attention to details in a historical thriller really surpassed my expectations - usually you see the historical accuracy being compromised but 1979 did the period justice. I don't review content that often but iNK is an indie studio and I know they can use the support from pleased customers.

It is a mixture of a strategic RPG and survival management. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are unique and enhance the immersion. The world is inspired by Nordic aka Viking culture and mythology. Story: The goddess Loom Mother created the humans by learning to weave life into the world. The other gods wanted to do this too but had often not the skills or patience. Some imitated this by creating other races like the Varl (Giants) or Horseborn (Centaurs). One angry god however created the Dredge who are living humanoids out of stone to destroy the other races. He was punished by the Loom Mother but this ended accidentally with his dead to every gods shock as they thought themselves to be immortal. The gods then fought and killed themselves or are in hiding but there is no evidence for the last. Meanwhile the before fighting Varl and Humans made peace to repel the Dredge. They won and the Dredge seem to be gone. However many years later the sun stopped at the sky and the Dredge seem to return in numbers unlike before. This will be a struggle for survival. I like the story and the dread. You feel the menace and the harsh battle for survival. Together with the well done characters it is an immersive and enjoyable adventure. Game play: Firstly the strategic RPG parts. It is turn based but not with a speed attribute. You are in control of up to 6 characters per battle. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers except one is down to the last man standing. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns it is your same characters turn again. When the enemy has 8 it will be 16 before the same characters turn. Be careful! This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. You have an armor and health rating. Health is also attack power and this is an interesting concept. Lets say attack power 9 against armor 7  with 10 health. This is 9-7 = 2 damage and with this health is 10-2= 8. The possible damage output is lowered from also 10 to 8 for the damaged character. You can attack the armor instead but this is a separated lower value. You do at least 1 damage no mater the armor but with high differences the hit percentage is lower and lower. You have also willpower that can be added. You have a stock and a value for max adding. The value will be added to the result. Lets take the above example and use 2 willpower. Damage 9-7=2+2=4. Useful in many situation as it can also be used to increase moving range. The character level up with enough kills but you must pay the level up with more and more renown (See below) for this and it is not much status increase per level. Also you can equip better artifacts (only 1 per character) and each 2 levels your willpower based special skills get better but also more expensive. A simpler but really enjoyable system with some depth. Then there is the survival part. Some say it is similar to the classic “The Oregon Trail” but I think this is not familiar anymore. You are the leader of a caravan and must protect its people. You travel through the lands with them and must get food and this is also bought with renown points. You get those for defeating enemies and some events. It is harsh decision making between level up and buying more food. Starvation is a thing and more people need more food. There is a moral rating system and this will be also with benefits and penalties. There are random and scripted events where you have to made decisions. Your decisions mostly have consequences and you can gain or lose heroes, food, moral and people too. It is a cruel situation and as leader you have to make harsh decisions or let others pay the price. I forgot that defeated heroes need recovery time except on easy difficulty (And more on hard). You can still use them but they are really weakened. Resting improves moral, heals wounded heroes but it takes time and consumes food. I think this is a good set up and the rest is easy to learn. The game worked really well with its story, characters and challenges. Even normal gets really hard later on when you want to be noble leader and safe as many lives as possible. Then there is the graphics. It looks hand-drawn and the world and characters look amazing. Another game where I would buy an artbook. The soundtrack is truly good and I was amazed that they used artist I already cherish like Malukah, Peter Hollens and Taylor Davis. They have good YouTube channels by the way. With this the game is a masterpiece for me. Overall a good game creates emotion and has an addicting gameplay. This is true for the Banner saga and the mixture is worth 10/10 for me.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-banner-saga

Try the combination of, no pickups, drift gift, pinball, ice skating and the floor is lava on Survival, most insane fun I've had in ages. If you are looking for a party, or a kart style game, you should get this one, I highly doubt anyone would regret dropping the asking price (less than $20 aussie dollars) on this excellent game. This will be the game I gift to friends for their birthdays this year (if you are my friend, forget you just read that). Would (and will) obliterate cute alien racers again. 10/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/obliteracers

El juego lo estoy jugando en Steam (obvio en una PC) y es un port de una versión del Xbox 360 que salió en el 2009 (solo Japón). Este juego es una adicción, lo vengo jugando seguido desde que lo conocí y aunque ya era “medio fan” de DoDonPachi (1997) fue el juego que definitivamente me hizo caer a ser cliente de CAVE, este juego es super-animero incluyendo los prototipos más comunes de waifus a seleccionar (maid, brujita, diablilla, angelito, SM-- ¿uh… WTF?) además al ser un shooter horizontal lo cual le de un “feeling” más nostálgico a todo, ¡ah viejo jugador de R-Type (1987), nunca cambiaré! En el 2011 “todavía” usaba un iPhone, traía el 4 cuando salió en el Apple store la versión de iOS de este juego. Me encantó, me hizo feliz por mucho tiempo sin embargo, por desgracia abandoné el uso de iPhones ese mismo año en favor de los celulares Android (el iPhone 4 tuvo tremendo problema con antenas, y perdías muchas llamadas) y pues nunca más regresé al mundo de celulares Apple. (aún así, también lo recomiendo mucho, por allí dicen que también ya salió en Android, así que habrá que probarlo también). Es decir, es un juego que juego por temporadas y creo que cada vez que lo vuelvo a retomar le saco más y más. Con eso lo dije todo, es ese tipo de juego que con el paso del tiempo sientes que pagaste menos de lo que vale, y entrega mucho más de lo que pensabas. Es un juego fácil de jugar, difícil de dominar (cliché, pero tenía que decirlo), y ahora con el Halloween del 2021 tan cercano ¿por qué no? ¡A volverlo a jugar nuevamente! La versión de Steam es definitivamente una joya, te dan TODO lo que se ofreció alguna vez a los poseedores de ediciones más caras (claro, años y años después), tanto las versiones clásicas como las definitivas e inclusive los extras como los Soundtracks, razón por la que no puedo recomendar más conseguir esta versión. Una compilación de Deathsmiles 1 y Deathsmiles 2 saldrá a la venta para Playstation 4, Xbox One y Nintendo Switch este mismo año en Japón, con suerte veremos algo en el store en este lado del charco eventualmente para quien lo quiera en otras plataformas. Mucha gente que juega este juego se confunde mucho con varios conceptos, me gustaría aclararlos por delante. Al comenzar el juego te da varias opciones de títulos, aquí la explicación: • Arcade – La versión original de la placa CAVE CV1000B. La versión tal cual salió en arcades en aquellos ayeres. Los gráficos son los originales de aquella época y recuerden que se supone que eran los adecuados para jugarlo a una resolución más baja y conectado a un monitor CRT.• Normal – La versión del Xbox 360 que incluye gráficos ajustados. Esta es la versión incluye gráficos para jugar a mayor resolución y varios ajustes gráficos, es verdaderamente una carta de amor y una joya para este juego esta actualización gráfica y lo que hace interesante comprar esta versión.o Los gráficos son rehechos (menos los fondos).o Los capítulos EXTRA (valle) y FINAL (castillo) ahora tienen dificultad seleccionable, 1 y 2 y pueden seleccionarse varias veces.• Mega Black Label – En Japón, hubo 200 copias de esta edición de Arcade, esta vez para la plataforma CAVE1000D. Es una versión especial en la cual se agrega a Sakura como jugador seleccionable, el Templo de Cristal como área extra, y un modo de dificultad 999. También la manera de hacer puntos cambió.• Mega Black Label 1.1 – Cuando salió la versión de Xbox 360 en Japón, se vendió a ese mercado un DLC que incluía el “Mega Black Label” y un set de tarjetas de voces para usuarios de la edición limitada anteriormente solo disponible a los poseedores de la “edición limitada” de este juego.• Versión 1.1 MBL – En esta versión, el jugador puedo controlar al familiar de manera independiente con el segundo stick del control de Xbox 360. Se cambian los órdenes de algunos botones (es configurable). Otros cambios notables son:o El contador de artículos se prende cuando llega a 100.o El límite del contador de puntuación es aumentado a 99999 puntos.o Durante batallas con jefes, balas reflectadas son disparadas durante el modo de poder aumentado.o Cuando la dificultad es 2 o mayor, balas reflectadas son disparadas durante el modo de poder aumentado.o Cuando la dificultad es 3, el “death mode” se activa automáticamente.o Cuando se ataca a un enemigo con el auto lock, el contador de artículos aumenta.o Vidas extras se dan a los 30 millones y al 1000 millones. No puedo recomendarles más este juego.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/deathsmiles

You get the strengths of the first game and some good additions I will describe below. It is a mixture of a strategic RPG and survival management. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are unique and enhance the immersion. The world is inspired by Nordic aka Viking culture and mythology. Story: The northern lands of Varl (Giants) and Humans have been overrun by the Dredge (Humans made of stone). You have lead your Clan of survivors through a lot of struggles of the prequel and have defeated Bellower but with a harsh price. The city of Boersgard is save for a while but cant be defended against the sheer numbers of Dredge. The Dredge will continue to overrun the continent and you have to continue your journey with the survivors to a safe place. There is even a darker possibility on the horizon that the Dredge are also on the run from something worse but nothing is sure. Maybe the capital of Aberrang where the human king resides is safe enough. Like the prequel it will be a struggle to survive. Especially if you try to safe as many people as possible and also keep them fed and in high morals. I enjoyed the stories and the characters have grown on me as I lead and protected them. You have the option to import your save from the first game and take all decisions, characters, items and resources with you. Game play: Firstly the strategic RPG parts. It is turn based but not with a speed attribute. You are in control of up to 6 characters per battle. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers except one is down to the last man standing. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns it is your same characters turn again. When the enemy has 8 it will be 16 before the same characters turn. Be careful! This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. You have an armor and health rating. Health is also attack power and this is an interesting concept. Lets say attack power 9 against armor 7 with 10 health. This is 9-7 = 2 damage and with this health is 10-2= 8. The possible damage output is lowered from 10 to 8 for the damaged character. It gives depth and some tactical options. Each character can level up, learn abilities and improve the stats a bit. Then there is the survival part. Some say it is similar to the classic “The Oregon Trail” but I think this is not familiar anymore. You are the leader of a clan / caravan and must protect its people. You travel through the lands with them and must get food and this is also bought with renown points. You get those for defeating enemies and some events. It is harsh decision making between level up and buying more food. Starvation is a thing and more people need more food. There is a moral rating system and this will be also with benefits and penalties. There are random and scripted events where you have to made decisions. Your decisions mostly have consequences and you can gain or lose heroes, food, moral and people too. It is a cruel situation and as leader you have to make harsh decisions or let others pay the price. I forgot that in battle defeated heroes need recovery time except on easy difficulty (And more on hard). You can still use them but they are really weakened. Resting improves moral, heals wounded heroes but it takes time and consumes food. I think this is a good set up and the rest is easy to learn. These parts together made an excellent experience. The sequel made a lot of improvements. Now you can train clansman to become warriors for the price of some resources but beware clansman will collect resources too from time to time (Less resources for less clansman). Training has now has a purpose. A trainer sets up special training battles for your characters. If you win by fulfilling the conditions you get a lot of renown. Also some good combo ideas and shown how to use characters efficiently. Of cause there are new characters, items, abilities, enemies and classes. There are a few additions in gameplay like barricades and obstacles on the battlefield. All this makes the gameplay better. The game worked really well with its story, characters and challenges. Even normal difficulty gets really hard later on when you want to be noble leader and safe as many lives as possible. The graphics look even better than before. It looks hand drawn and the world is beautiful. I truly like the art work for the characters, cities and items.  The soundtrack is truly good and also a bit better than the prequel. I was amazed that they used artist I already cherish like Malukah, Peter Hollens and Taylor Davis. They have good YouTube channels by the way. Overall this surpass the prequel and is easily worth a 10/10 for me. The gameplay is superb in this combination and with the story and characters it is a masterpieces.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-banner-saga-2

I’m not big on games that move over from the mobile platform to PC as nine times out of ten they just don’t work for me. Dungelot has been a pleasant surprise in this respect, it’s not all that bad.Dungelot is described as a hybrid between a dungeon crawler and minesweeper and it’s a pretty accurate description, but it’s far deeper than that. The game is played on a 5×5 grid that’s covered with rocks, as you uncover each square you might find one of a few things. Items, food, enemies or the dungeon key which is perhaps the most important thing, as opening the door to the dungeon takes you to the next floor. Enemies will restrict you from uncovering the squares around them until they are defeated but don’t be tricked into taking on every enemy as this is a quick way to die, rather avoid it if you can. Food is needed for progression as moving to another floor with no food will give you a penalty to your health and items offer a range of benefits to the player like bombs to fight enemies or buff giving potions. Items used correctly can be a life saver and you quickly learn to manage your inventory to match your style of play.The game also has a selection of mini games and diversions to partake of which pop up as you quest, these are a nice little extra that keeps things fresh. All in all it’s an enjoyable experience to play with a fair bit of humour in the narrative too and while I’m not a huge fan of puzzle games which I would consider this to be I have found myself playing quite regularly. It also helps that the art is pretty good in its cutesy anime style, I’m a sucker for good artwork.The heart of Dungelot is a mobile game no doubt, but it’s not a mobile game that needs you to keep playing every hour to collect something or do something, there aren’t even micro-transactions and this helps to make the experience a pleasurable one. I’m not being forced to play or strong armed into spending money, I can hop in as and when I please and have a quick blast. It doesn’t matter if I played an hour ago or a week, which probably makes me play it even more.It’s not a hard game to understand, it’s a simple puzzle game that’s all about having a bit of fun. It’s enjoyable and the fact it came out on mobile first really doesn’t matter as this is just a puzzle game that happens to have been on mobile, it looks great and plays great on PC instead of being a bad port of a bad game which is what I’ve come to think of when I talk about mobile ports. There’s no earth shattering graphics or gameplay that reinvents the wheel, it’s a colourful, bright and fun little game that I highly enjoyed.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/dungelot-shattered-lands

So often I was playing through this expansion with the exact same feeling as playing the originals all those years ago. The technical upgrades are self evident and dont need explaining, as after 17 years there was bound to be. There are some technical hiccups here and there but over the coming weeks and months I expect to see them stomped out. However I should point out that in about 30+ hours playing time I personally have yet to encounter anything game breaking or indeed little more series than a  single crash to desktop. Beamdog have wrote a fun, engaging story and while its a little linear it IS an expansion pack, although with the amount of effort put in it sure as hell doesnt feel like it. Id most definitely put it up against Throne of Bhaal anyday to say the least and would go a step further in that in some areas it gives BG1 and Shadows of Amn a run for their money. Great to have so many old favourite characters back with their original voices. I just cant overstate how pleased I am with the work thats gone into this to make a worthy successor. I only hope Beamdog release some additional BG2 content. With the great improvements made and the fantastic job on the writing front it would be a travesty for them not to. Also finally Ill end on the biggest disappointment surrounding this game with sadly is of no fault of its own, It seems some people have taken offence to (no exaggeration) 30 seconds worth of content and decided to declare some kind of silly war on this game. I get annoyed by excessive ""social justicey"" nonsense as much as the next person but i can honestly say anyone who thinks this game is forcing such nonsense on anybody and is trying to attack it should seriously examine their priorities in life. If anyone thinks its worth trying to smear years of hard work thats gone into this game because they find the tiniest snippet not to their tastes - well I dont need to worry, Im sure real gamers out their know to discard their silly opinions. This is expansion is great and is Baldurs Gate in every sense of the word and as someone who started in 1998 I cant express how happy that makes me.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear

My expectations were pretty low and, in a general sense, I hate online multiplayer games. Within an hour of playing, Werewolves Within became my favorite VR game for any headset, and as someone who worked in the VR industry I've played nearly all of them. Not only that, but without any hyperbole at all, I can say this will go down as one of my favorite video game experiences in the 30 years I've been a hardcore player. The gameplay is dead simple as the only mechanic is talking. The rules appear complex at first but are really very easy to understand after a few matches. Fundamentally, this is a game of sitting around a campfire building alliances, and deceiving others. Lots and lots of deception. If you've ever dreamed of being a trial attorney, this is as close as you're going to get without passing the bar. You're either a werewolf or not and regardless of your game assigned role, it's up to you to convince others you're on their team. A match lasts about 10 minutes. For the most part, everyone is civil and attempting to play the game in earnest. When you get a great group, you'll spend hours with them and make some great online friends. There are a few things to be aware of, however. Just like IRL, there is an absurdly high chance that many of the people sitting around a campfire and arguing about who is a werewolf are stoned and/or drunk (myself included). It's utterly hilarious but it can quickly get out of control (usually the drunk ones, but you can vote to kick them). There aren't many bugs or flaws but there are a few things to be aware of for parents. While this seems like a general audience game and good for children, it's a double edged sword. On one hand I really think it can help with social interactions and anxiety and, for a video game, is a safe and somewhat less wasteful way to spend time. On the other hand, the aforementioned drunk players will often use bad language and inappropriate slurs the like of which you'd hear in a move rated R. Additionally, you really need to be comfortable with your children playing a game exclusively about lying and deception. If I had kids over the age of 12, I'd let them play but not without a serious discussion beforehand and a promise that they would leave any group of ""bad people"". As someone who values intellect, group leadership and strong interpersonal bonds above most else, I find this ""game"" nothing short of a revelation that will stick with me for decades. This really does represent a defining moment in technology and digital human interaction while being the most fun you can have on a Saturday night. Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit for bankrolling such an innovation and Red Storm just became my favorite developer of 2017. The team at Red Storm is extraordinary and I hope to meet them one day soon. You owe it to yourself to buy and play this game, it's more fun than you've probably ever had playing a game and you'll be a part of something that is destined to become a historic milestone in the advancement of technology. There is zero reason not to be a part of this experience.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/werewolves-within

One of the defining games of my childhood and well deserving of this re-release. Originally released in 1998, this take on Battlezone was itself a re-imagining of the 1980 arcade game. It blended first-person vehicular combat with real-time strategy elements to create a revolutionary hybrid game experience that has only been briefly revisited since, in games such as Sacrifice and Brutal Legend. In 1952, as the story goes, a meteor shower in the arctic circle brought a previously unknown organic material to Earth. Simultaneously discovered by scientists of both the US and the Soviet Union, this ""Bio-Metal"" was soon discovered to have the unique ability to remember shapes it had previously assumed. From this material, the superpowers created hovering tanks and weapons centuries ahead of anything they could have otherwise made at the time. They quickly ran out of it, and turned their eyes towards the stars in search of more. In secret, the two nations sent thousand-man armies into space. Thus began a new, hidden chapter of the Cold War- the one too brutal to televise. You will journey into space in search of the bio-metal, and the truth of its origins. You take the role of a soldier of either the Americans' National Space Defense Force, or NSDF, or the Russians' Cosmo Colonist Army, or CCA. You begin most campaign missions, as well as multiplayer strategy matches, with your own tank and a Recycler- at once your core base structure, your resource depository, and a factory that produces all other essential units. It exists in a mobile or deployed state, able to travel (slowly) about until you find a geyser over which to deploy it, whereupon it becomes able to build. You have two resources: scrap, and pilots. The former are gathered by scavengers, autonomous resource-harvesting vehicles built from the Recycler that will wander the map gathering bio-metal scrap, found lying around in fields on most maps, or generated from destroyed vehicles and structures. Controlling these scrap fields and assigning escorts to your scavengers is crucial in more difficult missions, and in multiplayer. Aside from the two story campaigns, there are a variety of multiplayer modes, including deathmatch, strategy, and ""MPI"", a form of co-op strategy versus AI. This Redux includes extensive Steam Workshop support- you can download maps on the fly even in-game. It also includes updated models and visual effects, trading cards, achievements, and other niceties- aside from running very smoothly on modern systems, more so then it ever did in the old days. However, it is a essentially a straight re-release, and does not attempt to address any of the game's existing shortcomings- save the netcode, of course. You are limited, for example, to only ten units of each type, since that's as far as the number keys go, as well as the hard pilot cap of 30. The AI is single-minded at best and suicidal at worst, with frequent issues with pathfinding, often getting stuck trying to scale inclines the player would have no trouble at all with. Scavengers are completely incapable of not only defending themselves but even of reacting to being attacked, and will continue on their merry way scavenging in the face of certain destruction. Artillery units will fire at will regardless of the risk of hitting your own forces and cannot be set to hold their fire. Your offensive units also require careful management ot get the most out of their attacks. The walkers are also so painfully slow that their use in most campaign missions is extremely limited- its entirely possible to finish CCA Mission 6, for example, without the use of the three Golems you are given. Most campaign missions also have only one or two safe methods of completion, with very little room for experimental tactics. However, most of these flaws are attributable to the limitations of the original game engine, and and while they are even more glaringly obvious all these years later, there is something to be said for bringing the game to Steam and a new audience as is, the way we enjoyed it 18 years ago, and it is certainly easier to forgive then a brand new game with these same flaws. Battlezone was something completely new and any problems it had were excusable in the face of how much fun I had with it, and it was a great pleasure to revisit this landmark title in both my young life and the history of PC gaming. I urge newcomers and old hands, shooter and strategy fans alike to pick this one up. You will not be disappointed.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/battlezone-98-redux

You control a ball, and your goal is to navigate your way through 20 levels, collecting little sparks (the game’s collectable) and avoiding dying as you go. The game is very simple – there isn’t even a jump button. You can simply move in any direction, or speed up your rolling in a sort of dash move. The dash move makes it so you die instantly if you take damage, rather than simply… well, taking damage. This makes it risky to use at times, so it must be used judiciously. The levels themselves present virtually all of the game’s mechanics. Each level has its own set of unique mechanics, and only a relatively small number of them recur – and those which do generally show up no more than twice, save for the most simple of things (jump pads, laser beams, switches, bullets, damaging patches of ground, ground sections which kill you unless you have picked up blue “keys” to roll over them with, which each deactivate one such spot). However, the game still has a pretty broad variety of levels. One level sees you constantly phasing in and out of reality, allowing you to pass through/over deadly ground without being harmed. Another has the ball “hiccupping”, launching the ball in the direction of travel through the air every time, allowing you to clear gaps which you could not otherwise clear. Another level has a rhythmic bouncing which keeps sending you up in the air, a much more controllable thing than the hiccups – but you have to do much finer manipulation with it. That level also has a laser beam from the sky that damages you for 10% of your health every few seconds, limiting the time you can spend boosting as well as forcing you to get through the level within a short period of time (and avoid taking other damage). Other levels distort the view of the camera, require you to solve puzzles, require you to bounce over pits using launch pads, use a gigantic ball which keeps trying to crush you to deactivate lasers and trigger switches, and a variety of other mechanics. The game feels like it is of the right length; if it was longer, it would probably get repetitive. But at 20 (fairly difficult) levels, it feels just about right. For added challenges, you can speed run the levels, which unlocks additional skins for your balls as well as various secrets. There’s also a scavenger hunt which requires you to use clues from the scavenger hunt area and then go into the various levels and hunt down secret areas, activating purple portals which give you directions so you can solve a puzzle where you’re running your ball over invisible blocks. The game also has a narrator of sorts. The narrator doesn’t talk, but he leaves messages in the levels for you. Some of the messages change as you progress through the levels; others appear when you meet certain conditions. The narrator not only explains mechanics (often in a roundabout way), they also taunt the player, crack jokes, make endless ball puns (indeed, virtually every name in the game is based around ball puns of one kind or another), and sometimes try and get the player to kill themselves (including in one level where a new deadly mechanic is introduced and the narrator tempts the player into killing themselves repeatedly by making false claims about how it works). The game has tons of checkpoints, so getting through the levels is not an impossible task even for a fairly mediocre player. However, if you want to get all the secrets, you’re going to need to collect every collectable spark in every level, and do it without dying – as well as speed run the levels. These optional challenges are much more, well, challenging, and combined with the secret areas from the treasure hunt provide a second, higher level of challenge for the player who wants to do more than merely progress. All in all, beating the game is likely to only take a few hours, but 100%ing it is likely to take 12 hours or so. If you’re looking for a fairly simple but challenging arcade-style top-down navigation game, this is actually pretty decent. The graphics are clean, there’s a bit of humor in it, and the gameplay is challenging but generally enjoyable. Just be aware that this is a very simple game which is very mechanically oriented and a fairly high difficulty level – there is no real story, just a series of well-designed mechanical challenges.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/road-to-ballhalla

If this is the standard the future chapters provide, I've no doubt my money was well spent. A Hitman game is an experience not many games provide. The opening training area with its multi-tiered ways of assassination can compete with full priced games. Each to their own, but I'm giving this a 10 for every aspect of content I've seen. The music , graphics, gameplay, story, control, UI, and value for money are contained in this taster of a bigger pie coming later this year.

Warning: You must do a bit of research to learn the mechanics (Or read this review but I will also advice to do additional research). It doesn’t help if you played Sphere of Influence. There are new mechanics that will only frustrate you if you don't know them. I consider this a new game in this case. Also they added stuff from Romance of the three Kingdoms (Also by Koei). But back to the basics: Nobunagas Ambition is a long running series of strategy games that started 1983 and is nearly unknown outside of Japan. You play as a Daimiyo (Feudal Lord / Prince) in the Age of the Warring States (Sengoku period) of Japan. In this time Japan was split into many principalities ruled by different clans who want to unify Japan. This time they added a career mode. You can start everywhere from Daimiyo (Prince / Sovereign) to lowest retainer (Samurai). As you obtain honour you climb the ranks and get more and more influence and responsibility. It is quite fun to start at the lowest levels. You get your first fiefdom and your assignments by your Lord /Daimiyo. You build facilities that have various effects. Some produce resources and others improve facilities. It is wise to build production facilities in range of the corresponding improving facilities. There is a description for each facility including how it can be improved. Example: Farms and paddy's improve with better irrigation. There are multiple stats for facilities. Not each facility needs all stats (mostly 2). Then there are concepts you can develop. Primary you unlock better facilities that give higher improvements. All production facilities have 5 levels. The higher the better. Tip: Don't go for perfection. It is not possible to archive everything at max level. A good solution today is better than a perfect solution in one year. As you fulfilled your assignments you obtain honour and get promoted. You become an overseer for a castle and later a city. Important tip: Always develop your initial fiefdom no matter of your your rank. You get a tribute of resources and access to your old stock of soldiers if I remember correctly. You can become a powerhouse with that in mind. When you reach the Regent rank you can conquer other cities (Do it alone if other clan members that are not your Retainers help it can be their city not yours) and increase your fiefdom or even rebel against your Daimiyo. The obtained honour can be used for requests. I mostly asked for additional retainers to get more things done (Also to get different targets in warfare when I got assigned to fight against a far superior enemy). You can also use money and time to befriend other Samurai. They will help you complete your task or in battle. In one case they even joined me as I rebelled. For the Samurai: As before each Samurai, Retainer (and Daimiyo) has different stats and abilities. Some are only good at warfare others are good at construction or agriculture and there are all rounders. The more famous Samurai / Daimiyo / Retainer have better stats and some have unique abilities.  Stats will improve on a learning by doing base and abilities can be learned on the same base. Depending on your Clans size you have a number of action points you can use for upgrades and improvements (The higher the better). This time on a Lord/Daimiyo level you invest in your districts. You should choose retainers with high stats for the tasks as they do better (≥8 is my advice should probably be over 10). Also as before the resources are connected. You can not build without wood or iron and not go to ware without provisions. As Napoleon said: An army marches on their stomachs. You can not muster all your soldiers and if you run out of supplies they will starve. Then there are the diplomatics task. You can send your retainers to scout (enemy)areas, secretly recruiting enemy retainers (Can join, betray former Daimiyo during battle or even join with their city in case of higher ranked ones. But only if they are discontent enough!), gather influence in tribes (Smaller clans that give all kinds of support), start diplomatic relations with other clans (Alliances, support, marriage etc.) and negotiations with the imperial court. For the battles: You chose a leader and optional up to 2 supporting Retainers (Always use 2 supporters as it improves your fighting strength) in each City. Then chose your troop size (Depend on availability and supplies). This time they added the warfare from Romance of the three Kingdoms in siege warfare. I like the concept. Its a battle map where you must make your way through fortifications and fight your enemies. There is also battles at sea but I have not fought one yet in multiple campaigns.

While I don't think the 360 original looked bad at all, this version makes the most of the original assets, and releasing on different platforms allows a new generation of people to experience this great game. The Good For those that haven't played the game before, Shadow Complex Remastered is a Metroidvania style game, and starts with a couple out for a hike. The main character, Jason, discovers his girlfriend has been captured, because apparently they had stumbled upon a secret military base, and a plan to take over the American Government. Jason's main goal is to rescue his girlfriend, but the more he explores, he realizes he has to take action. As you traverse the map, finding secrets and hidden passages, you begin to unlock upgrades for your weaponry and abilities, in true Metroidvania fashion. The ultimate goal of the game, besides rescuing your girlfriend and saving the country, is to uncover 100% of the map, and find all hidden collectibles as you proceed through the story. The more health and weapon upgrades you find, the easier it will make your path to victory. The great thing about this game is that the action and set pieces all flow together so well that you feel like a hero. The epic confrontations with giant mechs, helicoptors, and heavily armed soldiers will keep you on your toes. Everything flows together well to blend a great action game, with a sense of adventure, all while letting you explore if you want. The Bad The story of the game is standard fare, and though it is based on an Orson Scott Card novel ""Empire"", it isn't very memorable. I wouldn't call the story 'bad'...but it isn't that great either. While the story fails, that isn't the games main focus, so I can let is slide. Characters could have been more fleshed out, but the way this game plays, with minimal cut scenes, that could change the pacing of the game, which I wouldn't want. Although the combat and set pieces in this game are well planned out, the choice of having this be a 2.5D game causes some issues with the shooting mechanics. Luckily the places where it causes issue don't pop up often, but it can get frustrating dying because the gun didn't shoot where you wanted it to. Checkpoints are provided often, so you never have far to go if you do die, which is nice. The other main issue I came across in this game were certain sections where it seemed the camera didn't follow as it should. When I needed to swim through a cavern, the camera would focus on the sediment at the bottom of the water pool, and I couldn't see myself. Again, this only happened a couple of times, and it didn't change the gameplay, once I figured out where I needed to go and orientated myself. The Achievements The achievements in this game are pretty good. You will get at least 15 achievements for completing the game and finding all of the collectibles. Even more will be unlocked if you kill enemies a certain way, get head-shots, etc. The skill required to complete this game is fairly high, as you will need to complete it in under 2 hours on any difficulty, and under 3 hours on Insane. There are also a few achievements for the minimalist, like completing the game with 4% of the stuff you should pick up. Because of this, it will require several playthroughs. Final Verdict Shadow Complex Remastered is a great game that is highly recommended, and although it shows its age in certain places, it is still one of the best games available today, and owners of any of the platforms available should play it, especially those that are fans of Metroidvania style games. Give it a shot, and you won't be disappointed. And if you played it previously on the 360, play it again for the Challenges and new achievements!",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/shadow-complex-remastered

TASTEE borrows combat mechanics from Frozen Synapse, which means that you play simultaneously with the machine (or other players) and see the outcome of the turn. But I think they managed to make a far better interface, giving orders is much faster and different actions stacks very well in the same waypoint.On the THEME side, the motown late 70's style really catches me, game is not heavy on story, it is just a backup for the 30 solo play missions. I think they work pretty well and solidly, you have to make missions to obviously end the campaign and unlock new ""anti-heroes"".About MISSIONS, this is an squirmish game, so all look pretty much similar withing it's type (pickup, rescue, etc) but again it does the trick, focusing on the fight rather than the story and complex steps during missions.On the MULTIPLAYER side, I didn't played (I prefer to enjoy solo games rather than make other players wait for my turns) but probably it 'll work as well as Frozen Synapse (which I played A LOT).FINAL THOUGHTS : This game well deserves a 9, even a 9'5.

The characters are presented differently than before. This universe has been reused so many times by so many games and movies, that it is really hard to somehow make the backstory fresh, but Telltale handles it pretty well, in my opinion. Just as an example (which is not a spoiler)- Oz Cobblepot is a skinny tall person and not a fat, short one as presented in many comics and other entertainments. The story itself is also pretty good, but in the beginning it's quite slow, however by the end it actually gets more and more interesting and so I caught myself wanting to play more of the game and see the ending. The gameplay is also good, the combat is really good, but I can't compare it to other telltale games, since I didn't play any except this one. Your choices don't matter as much as expected. The outcome of the situation is still the same, unless it is a big choice, which is mostly who to go to save and go as Batman or Bruce Wayne Overall: The game is really good and with Episode 1 free, I think you should try it out, but consider the first episode to be one of those mediocre pilots, so if you won't like the pilot, there is no guarantee that you won't like the full game.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series---episode-4-guardian-of-gotham

When I went to sleep at 3 AM I felt full of awesomeness, and remembering the disappointment I felt over LotV that felt double great. The story felt very logical, realistic and believable. There were no pianos in the bushes, no deus ex, no invulnerable super heroes, just very mortal opponents shooting and hating each other. What I hated in LotV (and SCII in general) was the feeling of kids bedtime story, filled with incognizable gods, unneeded unexplained entities (like the Void, what is that and why do we even need it, good old endless Universe not enigmatic enough?), lack of logic (like where was the Spear of Adun when the zerg sacked Aiur?), all-powerful artifacts that can change your DNA, kill unkillable, ignore laws of nature and probably make you coffee too. The general feeling you are being fed a fairytale with dragons, knights and magic did not leave me through LotV playthrough. But SC is not a fantasy. Covert OPs got it all right - I had a feeling I was reading something like Heinlein's Starship Troopers with black ops twist, it was just so good. I can but only hope that Covert Ops will stick to that style and SCII plot will be redone in the same manner some time. Because in my mind, SCII story stopped just before the assault of Char, when magic started happening. The missions, units and Nova's loadout were simply on a very good level. I would lie to say I was astonished, after hundreds of games I played, but all felt good and solid. The game felt a bit short, as many people would agree here. I would definitely prefer awesomeness over length, but well, I did the pack in about two hours, looking up at my steam account I see the games I like have 30 hours of playing at least. Might be the only small flaw I would point out at the moment. As a conclusion, I would like to praise Blizzard for their good job. I was highly doubting as to whether to preorder the game or try it from the torrents first. Given that LotV story felt extremely un-starcrafty and out of place, and even though it might be decent by itself, but for sci-fi universe it felt like a disaster. Given that another Blizzard game - Heroes of the Storm - is struggling with basic balance and matchmaking still (and these slikes also keep Nova underpowered and not competitive). I had high doubts that modern Blizzard is able to produce decent product. I am just happy to be proven wrong now.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/starcraft-ii-nova-covert-ops---mission-pack-1

It works in a similar vein as Enter the Gungeon where each run is independent and you run through levels to a boss. You can earn cash and permanently upgrade your character in a few ways and even use your cash to purchase guns and abilities to start out with in the next run.This game's visuals and music are both pretty good. Not great, but definitely acceptable for the price point. The gameplay is snappy and intuitive and I really loved the fluidity and mechanics once I got used to it. In my opinion, the games best asset is destructibility. Virtually every wall, chair, vending machine, and door you see can be destroyed. This makes approaching fights really fun because you have a thousand options to each one. You can barrel through the door guns blazing or you can blast your way through 4 walls and hit your target from across the level. It's also really cool to see the absolute carnage you caused at the end of the levels as each blood splatter and enemy corpse stays on the level.I also really liked the games approach to guns. Instead of each gun having a dedicated set of stats, each gun has a level with its stats changing accordingly. This is great because it means no gun is necessarily better than another. You could have the best gun in the game, but if you find a different gun at a much higher level, it will be much better. This means that you don't have to use just one or two guns, you will be using all sorts of guns each time which really makes the game fresh and interesting for much longer.Overall, if you are a fan of twin stick shooters, pick this up. The story isn't fantastic but the gameplay makes up for it and there is a decent amount of replayability as the difficulty scales up after each successful run.

When I first saw it I thought it looked interesting but never imagined I'd have so much fun playing it. I'll start with the pros. Pros + 1. The combat system works really well. I'm a long time fan of turn based combat and found the addition of interactive elements and player placement helped keep things fast paced.2. The art style is excellent, it looks great for a 3ds game.3. The level design was great. The game is divided into 7 stages and i found myself eager to unlock them just so I could see which iconic area was next.4. The fusions system works well and its quite fun to see what you can create.5. I never needed to grind so the game never dragged for me.6. There are a lot of sidequests. Most of them are typical fetch quests, pointless flying through ring games or just more fighting but it is a lot of fun finding your favorite characters around each map and talking to them.7. There's a huge amount of fan service. Characters from dragonball, dragonball z, gt and super along with the movies.8. The story is new and doesn't rely on reusing scenes from the anime like a lot of dragonball games. It's not amazing but I liked it and the final fights were pretty cool. Cons - 1. The fights can be quite long, although as the game doesn't require much grinding this didn't bother me.2. A lot of reviewers complained that the attack animations are lengthy but I really enjoyed them with the exception of ring outs. When your character is knocked out of the ring you see the same animation of them flying through a mountain. It gets old and afterwards you have to reposition them on the map so this can slow the pace of combat.3. Recruiting characters can be annoying. You have to build up an attack meter and then launch a special move but it can be blocked. Also later in the game it's a challenge to build your attack meter without knocking everyone out first.4. You need to collect energy to progress to the next stage. This could be a little annoying but it didn't take too much time. Overall this is a really impressive game. I bought xenoverse at the same time but found fusions much more addictive. If you're a dragon ball/rpg fan and a 3ds owner then I really couldn't recommend it enough.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/dragon-ball-fusions

A solid plot with plenty of humour. Not a masterpiece, but the story is conveyed excellently through the campaign style. Story mode is not the primary focus of Cobalt, but it is a lengthy, challenging and rewarding campaign. The lore behind the game is intriguing and leaks through into some of the arcade mode maps, which I think is a really nice touch. Graphics: 9/10. It's not beautiful pixel art and it's no Mona Lisa, but playing some of the custom maps completely convinced me that this game can look really amazing. Sound: 9/10. The music is catchy and memorable and the sound fx perfectly match what is happening in-game, slowing down when the time dilation kicks in. I can't think of anything I would change here. Gameplay: Beyond 10. In an age of games where the gameplay is often left to one side, Cobalt turns around and says ""here's what it means to be a gameplay focused game."" The entire game is physical and feels very natural after a while at the controls. There are really endless possibilities to what can be done inside the Cobalt engine, which is why I'm incredibly excited to see that there are already modding possibilities. Never before have I played a game that creates so many awesome moments. Doing a backflip over a missile whilst shooting your gun at a grenade so it bounces off a wall and into another player is just tame to me now. This is the game that will make you squeal, will make you sweat and will make you feel like the most awesome person in the universe. Cobalt sets the bar for gameplay now. Forget Mario, forget Smash Bros, forget every other game under the sun. I will never be able to look at another game again the same way. If you think this is just another arena brawler like Duck Game and Towerfall then think again. I can't play those kind of games anymore without thinking ""man, I'd rather just be playing Cobalt.""",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/cobalt

The death of a loved one. It's not something you think about all of the time, but it's definitely something that has crossed your mind here or there. Fragments of Him takes you through the life and death of the protagonist, Will, and explores the effects it had on those close to him. The controls and gameplay mechanics are very simple and take almost no time to figure out. Basically, you need to interact with different parts of each scene and in doing so, the scene and story will advance. The beauty of Fragments of Him isn't really in the gameplay, or even in the graphics, it's in the story and narration. Throughout the story, you observe the the movements and emotions that come from those that were the closest to Will. Fragments of Him does a wonderful job of pulling you close to these characters. I often felt myself so engrossed in the story that I truly felt like I was a part of the experience and not just and ""observer"". Even though I could sometimes predict the outcome of some of the scenarios, it didn't matter as I loved watching how everything would play out. The character animations/models are relatively simple, but by no means does this detract from the experience. It's kind of hard to elaborate in detail the specifics of the story without giving away key parts that should really be left for you to experience on your own. With that said, if you are a fan of Walking Simulators, well-written narratives, great stories, or if you are just simply looking for a great game that you can loose yourself in for a few hours, Fragments of Him will easily satisfy. The Bad Short The Achievements The review was done on the PC (Steam) version of the game and does not have any achievements :(.  Looking at the Xbox Achievement list, they all appear to be story related so they will likely unlock naturally throughout story progression Final Verdict Fragments of Him does a really good job drawing you into the story and kept me emotionally invested throughout the whole story. I don't really have anything bad to say about it other than maybe the fact that it is short. The price is fair and the game plays well..

It's simple enough - swap tiles on a scrolling board so that your character can constantly progress, picking up treasure and defeating enemies along the way. Challenge stages can have you trying to deal with something on a fixed board, or puzzling out how to defeat a larger boss, though while I appreciate the variation I didn't often find them fun, even on easy mode. Bolted loosely onto this is an RPG mechanic where you exchange gems for better equipment, but it's really inessential - you can completely ignore it and still puzzle your way through the game, or you can upgrade skills and equipment at some length. There's six characters, 18 skills, assorted armor and weapons and status effects, so there is some variety there, but the levels are so similar it doesn't tempt you to replay it with a new character. Should you wish to max out your equipment to boost the game's longevity, the process of grinding isn't varied enough to remain enjoyable. Ideally, you'd have been able to switch characters at will, but they're locked to a save file. Replaying the game six times just to see what they do is a big ask. Frustratingly, my second save file (the one where I used the very easy ""jump anywhere, let your dog collect treasure for you"" one) was subject to a horrible glitch where about half the time the game stopped responding to touch controls. I went back to my first save and it remained fine, so that's something. Also, any google of ""swapquest"" brings up the widespread glitch that is that some crystals simply do not work - you need to collect all 12 - and one of them requires you to play the level up to 15 times for it to release (for me it was 8 times. All other crystals release just by tapping them or killing the red enemy holding them, they're not meant to be a big ordeal.) So, overall, it's a nice idea, presented extremely well, but it has a surprisingly short shelf life for a puzzle game and the RPG elements don't truly cohere with it.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/swapquest

Of course it's not without it's flaws. First and foremost the actual physics engine powering the game is surprisingly robust. It's pretty nuanced as well. You'll definitely need to dedicate some time to getting the feel for it. The graphics are serviceable, but nowhere near DiRT Rally quality. You'll often see a lot of pop-up, textures drawing in and really rough shadows. That said SLRE does have it's own certain charm. The sound effects and music are by far the weakest points of the game. While some vehicles sound throaty and give a satisfying growl, most sound like an angry bee hive and lack any sort of depth. Again what it all boils down to is how it feels and SLRE feels really good when the physics are hitting on all cylinders. Weight transfer plays a huge part in the handling, I'd say maybe even more so than DiRT Rally. Milestone really did excellent with the physics engine in SLRE. I keep talking about the physics because for all it gets wrong, it gets the feel of driving right. The AI in the rallycross events is actually pretty decent and will give you a run for your money. Though they often act overly aggressive and often slam into you as if you're not there at all. The framerate definitely leaves a lot to be desired and often hits in the sub 25 FPS range. Only a few times did it actually get in the way of driving, but not often. I'd say that there's enough room for SLRE and DiRT Rally to exist in your game library. They both have their strengths and weaknesses and complement each other quite well. If you have a chance to try out SLRE, give it a shot, it's worth your time.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/sebastien-loeb-rally-evo

The AI tells you that we are in an emergency situation, questioning why you aren’t helping. You rush for the terminal in front of you and everything goes dark. Blue lights flicker, the alarms silence and everything is immediately calm. How did I end up here? What is this place? How do I get out? This is the exact situation you find yourself in Nilo Studios’ fledgling game Asemblance. A first-person experience/psychological-thriller, Asemblance presents puzzles in both story and progression. The PC and PlayStation 4 game is a bit of an odd-ball; built for a relatively niche audience, the game rewards you by how far down the rabbit hole you are willing to dive. Neither the story nor the mechanics are spelled out directly, meaning it is up to the player to discover who you are, why you are there, and what everything means. Being as vague as I can, the game feels fairly heavily influence by P.T. and SOMA. Far more science fiction than horror, the game relies on the player to not only discover the story, but also to progress the game forward. The place you wake up in happens to be a memory holo-chamber: given the right input, you are able to explore your previous memories and interact with the environments. Unfortunately for the protagonist, the chamber has no exit doors and the AI seems vaguely malevolent, trying to prevent you from accessing certain memories. At no point is the player given express direction about where to go, how to unlock the next memory, or why you are even locked in a memory chamber. The answers are in the game, but requires a fair amount of sleuthing. The game takes places in only a handful of environments — roughly five — with scattered documents and messages around to give you an idea of what is happening. Like most first-person experience games, the controls are very basic. You are able to interact with a few objects, walk at a quicker pace, and zoom in on objects. And while this makes it sound like that doesn’t present enough variety, it is actually perfect. The game’s puzzle gets fairly challenging towards the end, so it is important to have direct knowledge about what the limits of your abilities are to impact the environment. Another thing to note is Asemblance is stunning — running in Unreal Engine 4, the limited environments presented are perfect down to every detail. From an office environment to an impeccable apartment to a woody grove, it is one of the best looking games on the PlayStation 4 (especially for its $9.99 price tag). There are the rare visual blips that are fairly noticeable, only because everything around it is so perfect. The game features multiple endings, each progressively more difficult to find than the last. As far as I understand, I’m (currently) the only reviewer to find the fourth ending, and no one has been able to find the fifth. This is the kind of scavenger hunt I love to see in games — it is what made P.T. so much fun, and the recent Resident Evil 7 demo so infuriating. In creating a puzzle so rigorous, the developer is either implicitly or explicitly asking players to discuss the game further, talk strategies, and pull out their hair collectively. The only true downside (at least with the four of five endings I’ve seen) is they are entirely too similar. While there are some small dialogue variations attached to each of them, experiencing the endings never felt rewarding. Thankfully, the puzzle itself (and the accompanying trophies) were rewarding in and of itself. To add to that, I mentioned the game’s audience is relatively niche — many people don’t play games to be intellectually challenged, or for a dense, puzzling story. The game is technically beatable in 15-20 minutes if you are going for the more basic ending. Meanwhile, I have spent roughly six or seven hours reading through the many documents strewn around, investigating each object, and trying to decipher how to unlock all the endings. I’m hesitant to call Asemblance “fun” — but that isn’t what the game is trying to be. Instead, it is a challenge to overcome for those interested in experimental gameplay and hidden stories. The game is dense, but rewarding for those looking to make the investment. The fact of the matter is, there aren’t a ton of experiences like this around on PlayStation 4 (perhaps with the exception of SOMA): puzzle-driven psychological thrillers are fairly scarce. And though the puzzles aren’t as rewarding or playful as The Witness, a small collection of my friends have been spit-balling theories and ideas back-and-forth for the past couple of days in  an attempt to unravel the last mystery. For $9.99, it is an experience I highly recommend trying out, even with its faults and being designed for a niche audience.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/asemblance

And Glen tries to find out why Ark 01 never opened when the other arks did. Its an intriguing story set in a wonderful apocalypse environment. The graphics isn’t amazing but I believe its better than both The walking dead and Life is strange. Gameplay is point and click puzzles mixed with a lot of dialog and dialog options just like expected. For me the puzzles was somewhat too easy but that could be just me.

Also would add that this is one of most unfairly reviewed games I ever encountered. Perhaps on same level as Alpha Protocol or Vampire:Bloodlines was smashed by game sites and reviewers, but are now considered cult classics. In any case, this is the game that takes best from Roguelike genre and fuses it with Dark Souls (like) gameplay. It is very very heavy on labyrinthine gameplay, so if you enjoy wondering trough huge labyrinths this game is a treat. The combat gameplay is not as good as Dark Souls, and in my opinion it was one of the letdowns that led to bad reviews - but DS sets the bar very high and this game is different. Other reason for some bad reviews is apparent repetitiveness. But what people dont realize is that everything in game is random generated - so you can come with super exciting levels or few sessions with completely same environments - or you can play forever and somehow never see that one map. In any case there is recognition crisis concerning this game, because its so different from what people are used too. And this is reason for some peoples disappointment. Bottom line - If you like roguelike games - This is hands down best 3D real time combat rendition of the genre. A fantastic game and must have. Cons:Combat is not as good as Dark SoulsWould benefit from more weapon types and armors Pros:Fantastic art style and musicGreat one of the kind atmosphere ( Tron meets Diablo )Best 3D roguelike on the market",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/necropolis

A True Gem. Arguably One Of The Top 3  3d Platformers On The System... Shadow Puppeteer is a very clever game that combines both 2d and 3d Platforming elements to create a game that blurs both platforming genres. The catch being, if one character strays to far from another character, the bond between both breaks and you die. The game requires you to solve puzzles, many of which require you to interact with the shadows of objects to manipulate the 'real world', and in turn, you use real world objects to manipulate shadows. Numerous situations may require you to control both characters at once, and can be quite challenging. Numerous collectable orbs are hidden throughout the game and can be collected by trying to stretch out long distances, the catch being, if you go to far, the link between each character will snap, and you will die. The risk and reward factor prove to be very amusing. Story is fantastic, it revolves around the main character (and his shadow) following a mysterious shadow villain that creates light/shadow monsters (as you progress through the story). Atmosphere is fantastic also. The game also contains some boss battles and running sections which require quick thinking, to avoid being destroyed by shadow / light creatures. All in all, a very fun and creative game.

Why am I not surprised...? Anyway, this game is a good, fun multiplayer experience in the vein of Senko no Ronde starring the cast of the Touhou  Franchise.  The goal is to use danmaku to outmanuver and box in your opponent to whittle away their life bar.  You can use Spellcards to act as a 'Boss Character' to force your opponent on the defensive.  Every character has unique properties, like Reimu's smaller hitbox or Utsuho's shots covering more screen real estate. The game includes a story mode and an Arcade Survival Mode where you face random opponents, as well as a Boss Survival Mode where you have to survive against spellcards for single player content.  Although singleplayer is bare-bones, where the game truly shines is multiplayer.  While the servers had issues on day one,  human opponents are smarter than the AI, and even then, a high level AI is brutal and fun to fight. As far as visuals go, they're what you'd expect from a doujin developer worth their salt.  The visuals are beautiful for what the devs could pull off, and the artwork is very nice.  While occasionally you will get lost when a melee attack is performed, characters rarely get lost in the hail of danmaku.  There are only a handful of stages, but aside from the grid, they all look very nice and true to their locations in the canon games. Finally, and an important note, the dialogue in story mode is amusing, even if it leans a little too close to Touhou fanon for my tastes.  Story Mode is very lighthearted and a good way to kill an evening.  In all, this is what a fan game should be:  A love letter to the fandom. The game has it's share of flaws, mostly being the servers on launch day being a little buggy in some cases.  Also, you cannot just pick up and play this game.  You will need the tutorial if you don't want your rear handed to you on a silver platter. This game gets a 9/10.  I would have given it a more fair score, but considering my contemporaries, I felt that the game needed a kinder review to begin with.  At worst, it's an 8/10, and worth your time if you want a good multiplayer experience and am a Touhou fan.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/touhou-genso-rondo-bullet-ballet

This wild and crazy bullet hell is going to test your skills, and your patience.You take control of your ship and try to drive off the last remains of an alien force that is threatening to destroy the sun.  These aliens are bent on your destruction and will send wave after wave to try and end your quest to preserve  life as you know it.Story aside, game play is simple, avoid incoming bullets and try to take out as many enemies as you can.  When you destroy an enemy, they will drop energy that can be used to upgrade your weapons if you are able to make it through the stage.  You can also use the right stick to jump to one of four different areas of the screen to instantly avoid incoming damage - this is a good thing because your screen goes from empty to saturated with bullets quicker than you can curse.  The jump or shift mechanic is something that you will have to get used to using as tapping the stick in the wrong direction will certainly be instant death.This game doesn't just require good reflexes and aim, it demands them.  You will get very frustrated fairly early into the 18 missions if you are not able to dodge incoming attacks.  The missions do feature a fair amount of check points, but even taking that into account, you are going to have to memorize EXACTLY where you need to be if you are not the quickest on the stick.  Even that is an iffy prospect when a few stray bullets will cause you to head right back to the last check point.  There are very few spots where you can actually earn health, so you have to protect what little you do have.  Unless you are playing as one of the alien ships - those things seem to be able to take a beating.The graphics in the game are beautiful.  You will fly over 8 different environments through the course of the game, but you don't just fly bottom to top.  The board will twist a bit in between sections which makes for a nice change over a lot of other shooters.  There is also a wide variety of enemies to blast, and they will light up the screen with missiles, lasers and  other deadly projectiles.  The music is a pumping score that unfortunately gets a bit drowned out with all the cannon fire.   Luckily you can adjust the sound in the options menu.The game boasts 12 achievements on the XB1 version and getting them all will be a testament to your skill as a player.  While 8 of them can be earned by making it through the game the rest will require something special.  You will have to complete 4 different levels without taking any damage, and that will be a true test of gaming prowess.Solar Shifter EX is available on XB1 and Steam. It has been announced as coming to the PS4.  You can grab it and test your skills for $9.99.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/solar-shifter-ex

I would consider the sound design and voice acting as good. Music is sparse but I did not miss anything. I also liked the graphics but there is some aliasing, which was not distracting to me. At times I had the impression that it could eventually cause nausea to sensitive people. There are a few locomotion or turning options which could mitigate these issues, but I did not try any of those and this was not a problem for me. The game takes place inside a not particularly big facility, but with enough variety that wandering around was interesting enough to me. The controls are less immersive compared to Red Matter, since You just look and click to interact with objects. But they do the job, and the possibility to pick up and rotate objects would not have added much. Unlike Red matter the puzzles are mostly non-environmental, but just very short mini games. All in all I really liked the story, and  exploration, gameplay and the story was varied enough and the  ""relatively"" short play length of 4-5h felt even shorter than it was. I got the game for cheap during a sale and can highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys slow, point & click adventures or ""interactive"" stories.

Stun or destroy enemies (depending on how many times they have already been caught in the net), collect the scrap then repeat. It’s a formula that has very little variation unfortunately. The game is very easy at first…you’ll fly through the first 2 zones of which there are 4 with 5 levels in each. The Factory is when things finally get a bit tougher requiring you to become a bit adept with the dash & slam moves. These can get you out of trouble in a pinch but most of the game will just see you running, casting a net then running some more. It’s these later levels where the game massively improves, urgency is needed & much more skill to survive the relentless attacks of the Bloxbots. The enemies only ever really become a threat when you find yourself surrounded by many but a quick slam can see you away to safety quickly. Faraday’s speed far outmatches the Bloxbots so running circles around them while casting nets is the sensible way to survive. Standing still for too long in this game will not only see you take damage but scatter your collected scrap around forcing you to pick it up again. It’s repetitive but addictive too, it’s the kind of game where you tell yourself you’re just going to do one more level but keep carrying on. The main story can be completed in a handful of hours depending upon your skill level but where the game really comes alive is in its challenge mode. Timed challenges spread across all the levels offering a more intense experience, easily my favourite part of the game. There are a different types of robots to unlock which adds a bit more replay value to the overall package but it’s not going to hold your attention for very long. The game does suffer from a few visual bugs & roughness, nothing game-breaking thankfully. The level designs are a mixed bunch, a bright & colourful world but with some levels lacking inventiveness. The music is well worth praising though, retro & catchy as hell. It fits the game perfectly and some of the later levels really capture the desperation you’ll feel as you try to survive the relentless attacks of the Bloxbots. Unfortunately the mutli-player side of the game is currently unavailable, going to be included in a free update soon. Local co-op/competitive modes will be a great addition to the game & when it is available will probably knock the final score up by a point or so. Overall: 6/10 The simple arcade gameplay is addictive & fun but the lack of variety, lack of available multi-player (currently) & visual bugs hurt the overall package.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/magnets-fully-charged

It was originally developed by Code Avarice but later sold to Digerati. The Good When I first started playing Paranutical Activity, I really didn't know what to expect. The first thing I noticed were the Minecraftian graphics. I have to admit, at first I was really apprehensive that I was going to like them, but they grew on me quickly. The game spends no time dicking around and throws you right in the action which is exactly what I wanted. It was very easy to get accustomed to the controls and how everything worked even though that was basically no guidance at all. The map and the general layout of the HUD was done well also. I liked finding the shops on each floor, it kind of reminded me out the shops in the original Zelda games. The bosses are really random and often bizarre The Bad The music got really obnoxious after a short time. Thankfully the settings menu is very simple. The dungeons are randomized, but they don't really change that much. The Achievements I played Paranutical Activity for 9 hours and 16 minutes and managed to unlock 6 out of 45 of the achievements for a total of 120/1000 Gamerscore. Final Verdict Overall I had a good time playing Paranutical Activity and I think it's reasonably priced at $9.99",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/paranautical-activity

Its gotten a lot of hate from trailers over bad animations and boring gameplay. I've played for about 30 minutes now and I have a few things to say that are good, and a few things that are bad. Pros - Customization is very well done, graphics look good, maps are redone nicely and look great, fast gameplay on the multimission maps makes it seems pretty forgiving when you die to something stupid, lastly the game runs not terribly and I can keep 60fps with an R9 290 and FX 8320 despite it being an Nvidia title. Cons - Mouse control is completely terrible and there is no setting to change zoomed aim in the game, you can really tell that the game was made for a controller which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, the zombies feel like cardboard when you shoot them which also sucks but they arent a main objective in the PVP modes anyways so it wont bother you much, last con I had was that it took me 10 minutes of going into lobbies and being kicked before I finally got in a game. All in all I think that they will fix a bunch of the network errors and hopefully a mod or something comes out that can fix the mouse, if these 2 things were fixed I'd say the game is easily worth $30 even as an RE COD its still pretty fun and will keep me entertained for a while.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/umbrella-corps

There's a hellstorm of negative reviews out there and I recommend finding them and reading them to better understand the vast amount of problems with the title, however, I feel that the completely negative reviews (even if they take a moment to praise the title) do not do the game justice at all. As such, being a long-time fan of the series, I will offer my review as unbiased as possible. The Good: -The 3DS version comes with a music CD and an artbook. While the main artist for Langrisser has changed in this release, I feel that the art is definitely reminiscent of the old-school Langrisser style. While not a perfect adaptation it still has the unique allure that Langrisser had. Also, the music is a perfect revival and fits right in. -Classic Army-styled scenarios often times pitting hundred of characters against each other via the troop method. -Some of the maps are modeled after previous versions (for example the giant bridge is a near-replica of the giant bridge in Langrisser II). Adds a sense of nostalgia and the changes to the maps (like the location of the bridge) add flavor to the idea of the world changing over time (especially since in Langrisser II they burn the bridge down, although I am pretty sure that bridge makes re-appearances in future titles but I am not exactly sure which ones). -The beginning questions which decide your class, stats, etc adds a lot of customization to your beginning character in a very thoughtful way. I am pretty sure this extremely similar to how they utilized this method in Langrisser III and IV (pretty sure it was used in one or both of those--definitely one but maybe both. Also, I can't remember if they used it in II but definitely not in I). -Hidden tiles are still in the game and the fact that there are no guides for them is both refreshing and frustrating. On one hand I love the thrill of finding an item using old-school tactics by searching for possible tiles, but on the other hand I lament knowing that I've surely missed several of them. -Relationship system is done well--not every answer is a good answer and some answers seem to annoy the person you're talking to. -Multiple paths (I've played through 3 of them but there may be more, not entirely sure without going through once more and trying a different combination). Basically allowing for 3 unique stories. -Classic Langrisser storyline with basically two themes running parallel: the war that the main character has been thrust into as well as his personal goal. In this case he is trying to reunite with his sister. -The enemy of my enemy is my ally. You play along with practically every character at some point in the game and under each path you control basically everyone at some point. I love how the game does not pigeon-hole you into a single path or faction. -Lots of content. Even as a seasoned veteran of all Langrisser series I've put in about 80 hours and have not completed all of the content on max difficulty yet. The three paths add a lot of longevity to the game. The Bad:-The quickest and most obvious critique is that the battle scenes are chibi 3D modeled, slow-paced sequences that are not terribly thrilling. While I did not mind it, in every previous release of the game I have always turned those battle scenes off for the sake of efficiency. This is the the biggest concern everyone seems to have and I do not share the sentiment--they criticize how horrible this battle scene is and I do not know ANY fan of the previous Langrisser titles who actually cared for watching the battle scenes--they have always been mediocre at best and so to expect FE quality battle scenes is beyond me. -Lack of ability to see stats on weapons/items before purchasing. I didn't mind this. Typically the more expensive the item the better it is and the description at the bottom basically tells you what it does. For example a Rod (200pt) would increase magic damage. Compare that to the Elemental Rod (2500pt) which also increases elemental damage. Use common sense and realize Elemental is noticeably better. With the limited character space I want to discuss the constant comparison to FE since yes, they're both similar tactical RPG's. However, while FE has tons more money put into production value for a more polished, better-looking product I feel that Langrisser has something FE will never have. The heart of Langrisser is a deep war-based story where great men and women lead mercenaries to accomplish their goals. It's more about war-based scenarios rather than 10 superheroes vs 10 villains fighting wars. While FE is a fantastic series with lots of money behind it, don't let the chibi battle scenes in this game scare you away. If you were a true fan of Langrisser and wanted at least one more title, then this will satisfy that desire.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/langrisser-reincarnation--tensei-
