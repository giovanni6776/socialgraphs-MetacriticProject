It suits the game well, but in its best meaning. Huge maps, sometimes frustrating level design (and I mean about the difficulty or the method to complete the goals). Fully 3D design, MI controlled built units (less than 10 per map!!) that you can take control anytime you want + the possibility to build other units that you control manually one by one. For me, the beauty of the game is the user interface in the first place. 1 tactical map (when you are there, the game is paused!) where you can give up to 8 or 9 orders per each unit even though they work cleverly by MI itself. During the game, you see a mini map and on the left top; a radar on the left bottom; you see the main screen and you can select 1 unit of your roster and while it is active, you see the live seed of its front/board camera. If you actually control or over-watch an MI controlled transporter or bomber aircraft, as an again additional live feed, you can see its bottom camera feed... Maybe it sounds too much, but during the game, it just works fine. Considering that the game is now 17 years old, the graphics are a bit outdated, but not ugly at all. The texture of the surface is very low, due to the capacity of the graphics cards back in 2001 and due to the huge maps. I play it now as I would be back in 2001. From 2001 perspective, it's beautiful.The textures of units are very good, the buildings are not bad at all, the water is quite alright. The sounds are OK, though not outstanding. The MI controlled units' voices are diverse, but they use the chat way too often, therefore it gets boring after a short while :( The music is OK for me, I never use it during the game though. The game is quite interactive. There are human units (not fighters) on the ground next to the buildings (lots of supportive/neutral buildings, fences, lamps) and the wood or rocks. You can even cause landslide by shooting at the right place - wtf :) Resource management is possibly the best part next to the UI. You can't mine fictional craps or chop wood or anything else. You simply recycle the destroyed units' and buildings' parts. Just like how we COULD do it in real life. You could see similar idea in the early RTS Total Annihilation, where you could recycle the ""wreckage"" of units, but this game puts it to a higher level.The ""wrecks"" corrode in the water and disappear after a short while. But they slowly corrode even on the ground. You can destroy these wrecks by shooting at them or driving over them by tanks. They are displayed on the radar and the mini map. The game physics are also well executed.

The move gives Triple Play another leap in realism, from the ultra-sharp graphics with real player faces and stadiums to the advanced AI that enables more realistic and flexible gameplay. The DUALSHOCK 2 controller's analog features are now a key element of the batting, pitching, and fielding control for a truer sports gaming experience. To get the game right, EA once again turned to the pros--American League MVP Jason Giambi of the Oakland A's and National League Manager of the Year Dusty Baker of the S.F. Giants lent their expertise on how to play hardball in the majors. Of course, in baseball, what it all boils down to is the showdown at the plate--the pitcher facing off against the batter for all the money. Triple Play Baseball again refines the game with a power zone/contact zone batting cursor--power hitters may have a tiny cursor, but it's all power zone, while more dependable sluggers will have a larger cursor but may have a smaller sweet spot. Batters are going to need all that control if they're hoping to tee off the pitching this year, which is also improved in control to give them every trick in the books. Players' skills are accurately based on player stats from last season, so if you see Mark McGwire at the plate or Randy Johnson on the mound, expect some bad things to go down.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/triple-play-baseball

Конечно.Spider-Man 2 Enter Electro делалась в спешке, ведь на волне успеха первой части и заката эпохи Playstation было необходимо выжать последние плоды. И у разработчиков получилось не только получить денег в карман, но и создать достойное продолжение, которое выполнено не хуже первой части. И это действительно редкий случай. Обе игры совершенно одинаково хороши. Они разные по своей атмосфере, но обе дают уникальный опыт того самого, настоящего Человека-Паука, к которому приложил руку легендарный Стэн Ли. Паучок засадил за решётку злодеев предыдущей игры. Казалось бы, наконец можно обеспечить себе хотя-бы пару деньков отдыха. Но не тут то было. Мало того, что Питер продолжает мутировать и просит обучения у Людей Икс, так ещё и во время мирного чтения газеты он замечает взрыв в лаборатории неподалёку. И с этого момента нам снова придётся проучить злодеев. Первое, что надо отметить - сменились тон и атмосфера игры. Они стали более взрослыми и мрачными. Даже удары противников ощущаются больнее, хотя разницы с первой игрой, по сути, нет. Наконец Паучку предстоит спуститься и побродить по улицам города. Но будет это не оживлённым днём, а ночью, когда все мирные граждане спят. Кроме ночи, есть много уровней с закатом. В первой игре нам особо не давали разнообразия в плане задач. Изредка на пути вставали какие-то головоломки, но теперь же здесь уникален почти каждый уровень. Догонять поезд, искать ключи доступа среди банд, зачищать локации от бандитов - всем этим и не только нам предстоит заняться в роли Человека-Паука. К арсеналу Питера прибавились костюмы с новыми способностями и новые виды паутины. Но и злодеи не дремлют. Летающие роботы, профессиональные стрелки - лишь пара примеров новых опасных противников. А боссы... Они стали действительно сложнее. Просто придумать тактику стало мало. На уровнях с драками против главарей будут доступны различные задачи, которые смогут упростить бой. Например, забраться на здание стройки и обрушить на врага металлический блок. В остальном же, это та самая первая часть. Сбор комиксов, интересная галерея, разнообразные костюмы - всё осталось на месте, но всего стало больше. 10 из 10.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation/spider-man-2-enter-electro

Graphics are mixed, which is somewhat excusable, given the games seemingly lower budget. Character modeling is decent, even good in places, but textures are sometimes muddy and ill-defined. Animations are janky, but in a way that oddly lends to the games surreal aesthetic. Much of the titles graphical shortcomings are made up for, in part, thanks to its excellent art direction. Story is strange, sometimes obtuse, but also compelling and engaging. Gameplay is fun and unique, thanks to the games use of an action-time prompt called the judgement ring, which permeates every aspect of the gameplay and encourages careful play due to its purposefully fickle nature.

I still play this game to this date, feeling like it is still brand new. The graphics killed every other game at the launch,even most out recently, yes including Halo, which I'm tired of hearing it still has the best graphics on the Box. No other game that I've played on the Box says XBOX like this one, at least to me. There has been only one other game like this before, being Cobra Triagle on the NES. There probably won't be another like it because of bad reviews when everyone was so caught up in Halo that everything else was overlooked or frowned upon. Also this game has millions of polygons running at 30 frames per second during the entire game which makes it difficult for a developer to make again since the first one was so overlooked and they won't spend all that time making another one(shame on you XBOX audience). I was hoping for a sequel but the so called professional reviewers screwed that up for everybody. I will only buy or play Xbox exclusives from now on because every time one of us buys a game that is also on the Playstation 2, we are not only having to settle for barely upgraded PS1 graphics, we are telling developers we will settle for barely passable games. Maybe I have forgotten what gaming is all about, but I haven't forgotten why I bought an XBOX in the first place. The most powerful hardware in a console bar-none, capable of blowing Gamecube and Gaystation 2 away. What every happened to the whole reason the XBOX was made for anyway? The graphics engine in the Box has been overlooked for far too long. It is time to awaken the monster and ""freakin' use"" the damn hardware. I might as well start backing Sony and flushing my money down the toilet if my XBOX games aren't going to look any better than Sony's garbage!",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox/blood-wake

First person mode didn't really bother me but hey at least it was better than dark tomorrows weapons controls. Batman's combat was very well done and the super moves was a blast to use and they were very good and quick to use compared to begins where begins combat system where slow and dull. Vehicles stages where awesome and the music was beautiful, which made me feel like i was in a episode of batman the animated series and environment captures the show.  Guys i know that this is old but at least ubisoft tried and gave us a good batman game where it made you feel like the dark knight and you gotta admit that the arkham games borrowed some elements  from vengeance and rise of sin tzu so without these games their would be no arkham and many people and review s such as kwing, ign and gamestop like this game. Also, i loved the stealth and quick stealth in this game. What is quick stealth? Well if people read the manual it is activated when you use a smoke bomb on a enemy and go behind the and press the y button to do a stealth take down, which is awesome and finish the combat fight smoothly in case you don't wanna fight or  you are lossing health.  Finding ammo is easy cause you just have to look around. Instead of bashing this game, i would like to thank ubisoft for redeeming themselves and worked hard in making this game because they would have just given us a half assed batman game like batman beyond return of the joker. Story was alright except for the first act but it was a good kind of alright cause it reminded me alot of the animated series and i loved the swat chase level cause it was a sort of homage to the batman mask of phantasm scene where batman was chased by the cops, which was my favorite scene and i love  playing that level.

However, you might get stuck on some pixel hunting several times. Story-wise and technologically, the Last Sanctuary (D:LS) is a direct continuation of Dracula: Resurrection, which was a much shorter game. I found the rendered backgrounds diverse and of very good quality even if the resolution wasn't very high. Voice acting was decent for most characters and sound effects and ambient music were quite fitting to set the atmosphere. Most of the story is told through animated cut scenes. Understandably, the animation is stiff for today's standards and some of the dialogues are silly but overall, the pace of the game is maintained with very few distractions. A new thing in D:LS as compared to its predecessor are the quick-time events, which are quite refreshing in an adventure game and also you can't easily predict them so saving your progress regularly is recommended.

Desperate to play it, I bought an Xbox copy instead, thinking it wouldn’t be much different. And it’s really not from what I can remember, everything that should be there is, well, there. I dunno if it’s considered cheating or not since I played it on Xbox 360 and not the original Xbox, but if it is, take this review with a grain of salt. I think that game is pretty solid is most aspects, the graphics are tight, the controls are responsive, the customization is INSANE, the car options are also INSANE, especially considering it had name brand vehicles from Chevrolet, GMC, Toyota... pretty much every well-known vehicle company aside from Ford. The game’s career mode is where you can buy and build your dream vehicle, adding roll cages, extra lights, bullbars, all sorts of aftermarket parts. The mission mode is also pretty amazing and is what I suggest you start out with first when going to play career mode, as the lag is barely noticeable, the controls are pretty responsive, and you get a big open map to search for your objective. It may take quite a while to figure everything out, but the soundtrack can help out in a lack of patience. But, again, despite this, it does tend to get tedious every now and then, but that’s what other modes are for to replenish your patience, that being the racing mode. Now this mode is a bit... not so good. The lag gets cranked way the heck up, the AI is annoying and seem to have a slight rubber-banding mechanic, vehicle collisions are a bit broken, and turning can be random due to the intense amount of lag. Because of all this it makes it dang near impossible to actually win a race, and because of it I actually have not won one single race by the time I’m writing this review. There is also no restart mechanic, so if you make a major screw-up (i.e. hit one of the checkpoint flags which you can actually do and the AI can also do pretty frequently) and you know you’re gonna lose, you’re better off just finishing the race if you’re on a final lap considering you still are going to have to go through two loading screens and a results screen. So, if you have the patience for it, I recommend sticking to missions first and racing later, since it also pays out a lot of money too. This isn’t to say the racing isn’t awful, the tracks are actually pretty good, with environment AI, shortcuts, and plenty of huge jumps. The tracks vary from a nice little race around a farmyard, to Area 51 and a nuclear waste site! Now because of this, I say you stick with time trials if you can’t stand the AI and lag that the AI causes. One more thing I think should be mentioned is the time it takes to save on 360. I dunno if it takes this long to save on the original Xbox, but it takes around 5 minutes just to save a game. I want to throw that out there since the first time I tried to save and it took that long I thought the game crashed, only to find out it saved just before I shut off my console. So, um, don’t do that. The game is most likely not broken, it just takes that long to save for some strange reason. Now, for my final verdict. Because of all this, as far as the Xbox version goes, I do recommend you play this game! But then again, I seriously suggest you stay below a budget that is around 20 dollars. Hope this review helped a few, and have fun playing 4x4 Evo 2!",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox/4x4-evo-2

The game's power was enough to drive me to play it again after two decades and help Heritius fulfill its task. Find Ulysses and recover its name, after the gods playing strange games with him. While this game could be huge and write history, for some reason developers choose to let it be, something more close to a regular adventure game. The concept of Heritius it's prototype, all the characters, allies and enemies well-desinged, with epic dialogues and very good acting that captures your attention(i fall in love with the scenario). But there are some disantvantages. The whole game doesnt take too long to beat. If you skip dialogues, you can beat it even in less than an hour. In fact, dialogues are these which give  some more duration. Next, is the fact that you have to be in the exact position in irder to move ,or to grab something. Moreover, if you dont press the right button, you'll see yourself making cycles and wandering...like Ulysses. Besides that, I have to point that the game is full of glitches which in some cases may be fun,but in some others you 'll see yourself stick in a vacuum without getting killed , but without being able to escape from, which puts you in a position to be very careful with your saves (which clearly is a huge boost for the game, as it lets you save whenever and wherever you want,by giving you 30 slots too). The challenges you meet are interesting and the puzzles really addictive, but could clearly be more. No Sirens, no Scylla and Charybdis, no island of Faiakes, no battles in the palace with your long-lost friend and Tylemachus against suitors, no encounters with gods (besides Poseidon). Stuff that would really change the game. Overall, I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, not because it is a mediocre game, but because it could be something much better, but the developers didnt even try make to be. In many cases, it is clear that the team didnt really put the effort they should. They just made the most  essential parts of the game,but they didn't fixed several issues. They didn't put additional stuff like this I mentioned before. In conclusion, the concept of the game was good enough, the prerenderd graphics are fabulus and give a necessary and sweet sense of nostalgia, characters intergrated, cursed, each one with his own story, interesting and challenging puzzles, wonderul environments accompanied by an excellent music, created from turkish instruments and a very good sense of the Homerus story, adapted in a video game.

As Tristan R. said, this isn't Gundam Wing but it's still a darn good game to play! The graphics are incredible. The death explosions have to be the best around, let's face it. The mechs themselves are truly a sight to see. From floating Doms to Lumbering Gundams, the mechs have an incredible amount of detail. When something comes just a little too close you can whip out your beam sabre and wack that punk up! The free floating camera is gotta be the best little feature in this game. You can actually see the FRONT of your mechs! That's hot $hit right there, friends! Let's see AC2 try to do THAT! Now about the controls. WHAT is so bad about them?!? They're PRACTICALLY IDENTICAL to AC2!! Control pad to move, R1 & L1 to strafe, square to shoot, triangle to change weapons and X to jump! All that's missing is an independent beam sabre button and the ablity to look up and down with the L2&R2 buttons. I'm constantly wondering what people are taking when they spout B.S like: ""Duhhhhhh..! Duh Cntrols ur reel baaaad! Dere sooooooo annoying!"" It's not THAT hard friends! I made you a freakin list up above! ""Well..! Uhh..! My Mech is WAY too sluggish!"" Then tap foward to boost across the ground or use a faster mech in Tactics mode! There is a BIG difference between a Gundam's speed and a Zaku's! ""My mech dont jump high enough!"" Press X MORE THAN ONCE to get a better boost! The Kampfer, for instance, hits the vertical boundary in 4 boosts! ""This'll NEVER beat AC2, Man..."" Dude! Just LOOK at the game! It's a mutherf** in Ac2/Gundam conversion!! Folks, some skill IS required to play the game! Sound is fine, no qualms about that. The mechs and weapons sound cool. The campaign basically outlines 0079's story which is pretty cool. I like taking part in that. The cutscenes are pretty bad@$$, it's straight from the cartoon. But by far the best part of the game was Tactics Battle. That's virtually all I play and I generally forget 1 player. There are WAY more mechs there. My ONLY qualms with this game are the lack of other mechs/mobile armor with more color variations and also how freaking strong your sheild is!

My nephew and I thought it was funny to take a different route in one of the Monaco tracks and be able to smash through the car-dealerships show room and shatter all the glass! Need to add more and make this a series. How about racing in San Fran Sisco? FLorida? Spain? and other exotic cities with lots of fun alternate routs? One complaint I have about the Design Studio, is that you can only adjust the front and rear forward and back. You should be able to change the center section and go up and down as well. Also, in the accessories section, you should be aloud to change the taillights as well as the head lights. Also, when racing in the dark/rain, it is very difficult to see.

Repetitive wouldn't begin to describe this so called wanna be Diablo game... There are four dungeons, four towns and four open field battle grounds to explore and that's it folks... And believe or not I had made to dungeon level 432 on all four dungeons!!! My stats were just crazy ridiculous!!! For example: there was this one move with a mace weapon that require magic (blue orbs) to make her spin round and round like that RATT song and this move required a hell a lot of magic to pull off this move kinda water a the desert and I could perform this move with ease for over 10 minutes before I ran dry one first tank of magic... Yep, crazy stats in fact: I had so much GOLD one time that I had the misfortune of discovering a crucial game glitch that will give you negative GOLD i.e. you can't buy nothing because you owe money glitch!!!  When you collected over a Trillion (1,000,000,000,000) dollars worth of Gold  and if you didn't know this having only two save files available to you, this will MAJOR LEAGUE SUCK FOR YOU, until you figured out or lucky enough to start selling your stuff to reverse that game glitch and you better hope you got a lot to sell!!! Now, the game will give you a FULL CALENDER YEAR Literally to prepare for this all important FINAL BATTLE against the EVIL LORD WHATEVER HIS NAME IS... But, there's a couple of catches... First, YOU DO HAVE TO GO THRU THE FIRST 100 LEVELS of EACH DUNGEONS TO RECEIVE OR GET THE ALL SPECIAL WEAPONS TO BE USED TO KILL THE FINAL BOSS!!! THEY WOULD BE A FIREARM, A BOMB, A SWORD and SOMETHING ELSE THAT DOESN'T COME TO MIND AT THE TIME BUT DO NOT SELL THOSE WEAPONS AND THEY WILL SAY IN THEIR DESCRIPTION BOX  THIS WEAPON IS FOR THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH REINCARNATION of the BLAH BLAH EVIL LORD"" and YOU MUST YOU USE THESE WEAPONS IN THAT ORDER 1,2,3,4 IN ORDER TO DEFEAT THE EVIL LORD!!! Because ALL YOUR OTHER WEAPONS COLLECTED AT THAT TIME  WILL DO NO DAMAGE TO THE FINAL BOSS AND HE'LL JUST BURN RIGHT THRU YOUR HEALTH if YOUR NOT LEVEL UP HIGH ENOUGH TO DO BATTLE!!! And HERE""S THE KICKER!!! When that year is up, you do not have to FIGHT HIM!!! It's on your schedule, HE'LL JUST APPEAR ON YEAR BEGINNING THE NEW YEAR AND JUST FLY AROUND AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE NEW OPEN BATTLE GROUND TO FIGHT HIM!!! TIPS: I've learned... Each town has a marker that is taken or stolen by their local dungeon which you will then have to get back if you what to used the town to level up your stats such as Strength, Health and Magic... There is a stat to improve her mental state to let the A.I. take over for battles like for dungeons crawling or whatever you want to be lazy in a battle and let the computer takeover for you but it'll be a waste of time as the A.I. will operate dumb no matter what level her mental stat is... I found that I like the mace as the weapon of choice because of the spin move, but the firearms are nice as well...  It just, that you can only carry a 100 rounds of ammo at one time and they can go so fast and sometimes the town person who's suppose to sell you the ammo may not have any to sell you... ONE KEY NOTE: ALL WEAPONS & UNIFORMS WILL HAVE SPECIAL PROPERTIES TO IMPROVE YOUR STATS SUCH AS STRENGTH, MENTAL, VITAL,HEALTH, FINDING TREASURE, EXP BOOST, ETC... THE KEY THING IS THAT ONE WEAPON OR UNIFORM CAN HOLD 3 ABILITIES AT ONE TIME SUCH AS: 99% on HEALTH, 99% on MAGIC, 99% on EXP all on ONE ITEM in different combinations as that is just one example...  Now, they have to on her person's in order to take effect and you can carry four weapons at one time and wear only one Uniform at one time!!! So you can boost your stats 5 times meaning if you got 4 WEAPONS THAT HAVE THE 99% on HEALTH, 99% on MAGIC, 99% on EXP as their PROPERTY ALONG WITH A UNIFORM CONTAIN ALSO  99% on HEALTH, 99% on MAGIC, 99% then Baby that's to the 5th POWER OF DOING SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE!!! Trust me you never want to sell or get rid of those weapons or items when you find them!!! I'm not going to ruin the ending for YOU!!! But you'll get a special code when you BEAT THE GAME, THAT YOU GAME INPUT INTO THE GAME IF AND ONLY IF YOU HAVE GAMESHARK!!!  AND TRUST ME IT IS NOTHING SPECIAL TO DO!!! FINALLY: There was a Dreamcast Version of this game Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse that was incomplete but can be view it on Youtube revison in gameplay and graphics to match that of Berserk Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage also on the Dreamcast that you can play and own...

You will get out of it what you put into it. It doesn't hold your hand, and it expects you to make a little effort. Engage with the game world, pay attention, and get invested, or it will leave you behind. If you do get invested, though? You'll find a complex story full of twists and surprises waiting for you. You'll find an engaging battle system that shapes itself to your play style through evolving skills and a ""catch up"" mechanic for less leveled characters that I've never seen in any other game. You'll find secrets, interwoven stories, and a world where your investment in it is rewarded. You can't just coast by in Ephemeral Fantasia. It is 100% true that it won't just tell you what to do next. That's because the game is open-ended. Over the repeating ""Groundhog's Day"" week of the story, you can do things in whatever way you want. Want to take a week to grind? You can do that. Want to spend a week learning the map? You can do that. Want to learn a particular NPC's schedule, so you know what they'll be doing at any given time on each day? You can and you should. Each additional party member you can recruit has to first be broken out of the cycle, made to remember what happened on previous loops, and the only way to do that is by learning about them, then using that knowledge to open their eyes. On top of all that, the game has multiple endings and characters you can miss completely depending on what you do. Despite the looping nature of time, it's a game where your actions have consequences and your choices matter. Of course, it's not a game without faults. Which begs the question, why am I rating it a 10? Simply put, for every fault I can list, there is a counterpoint for why I wouldn't let it affect my rating. It was originally made for the Dreamcast, and it has Dreamcast graphics. I don't hold that against it, because I love the Dreamcast and would never fault a port for being a port, even if the original was unreleased. The navigation and knowing what to do when can be confusing, but I don't consider those faults because it's an intended part of the game - as I've stated throughout this review, the game wants you to learn things by investigating, and make decisions for yourself. The last thing I could bring up is the songs you'll have to play throughout the game. On a regular Playstation 2 controller, some of these can be quite difficult to play. However, there are a few saving graces here. First, that the game lets you practice songs whenever you like. Second, that missing a song will rarely keep you from progressing the game. Third, the game supports a guitar controller in the second port, which will make things easier (I'm not sure if it HAS to be a Konami guitar controller or not). Lastly, and most importantly, if you really struggle with the minigame, there are some cheat codes available online that can make the difficulty trivial (as well as some for more of a challenge). All in all, Ephemeral Fantasia is a great game, but it's cute anime style can keep people from realizing that it's also a game that expects you to ""git gut"".",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/ephemeral-fantasia
