Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice City from the air?

1,Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars,xbox,"Feb 24, 2002",,67,6.3,Kodiak Interactive,"Encore Software, Inc.","['Driving', ',                                            ', 'Demolition Derby', ' ']",1-4 ,T,"Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars = Pure awesomeness. Go through the first few Academy stages to begin, there is a brief learning curve. After all, you will be driving a chariot mostly along winding hazardous roads while simultaneously wielding a weapon via the warrior on back. Literally every button has a function, and most of them are necessary at some point in a race. For example, you may need to pull left trigger for that tight left turn, or pull the left stick back to duck under a low handing branch. If you want to dial back the complexity at any point you can 1) set difficulty level to Novice (easy), and the chariot will not tip over around sharp turns (tipping is avoided by leaning your warrior into the turn), 2) turn on auto-pilot during the match, so you can focus just on attacking with your warrior, 3) in multiplayer, have a buddy control driving or fighting with their own controller while you do the other. Regardless of your starting method, I've little doubt you'll wish to control more as you progress. The more you familiarize yourself with the game controls, the more fun you'll have attempting to juggle them throughout the race. Of course the graphics will lack compared to today's games but they are plenty good, and you'll be too engaged in the action to care. All of the interaction between chariots, road hazards, warrior attacks delivered and received, all feel very fair. If a chariot wipe-out leaves you confused as to the cause, the fun auto-replay of the crash likely clues you in as to what it was. Very rarely does the chariot seem to crash for no clear reason. The chariot wipe-outs are hilarious, with horses, chariot, and occupants all tumbling, sometimes flying. The core experience I've had with this game is one which rides a nice balance of challenge, entertainment, without being overbearing. I found myself consistently seeking to improve my ability to drive and fight at the same time, because I feel rewarded for doing so. Taking out an opponent in mid-race feels great, winning the race feels like an accomplishment. Even crashing or losing the race feels exhilarating because it's so much fun and there's a feeling that your controller skills progressed a least a bit more. You want to go back in and put those skills to the test. I bought this Xbox game many years back in a bargain bin and it is still a blast to play, solo or with others. You can play up to 4 at once (2 driver/warrior tandems fighting head to head). It can be played on Xbox 360. I'm not familiar with it's availability on other platforms. Nowadays everything is online, so the dream would be to have this game remade with that capability, as well as more tracks, along with customized and upgrade-able chariots/horses/drivers/warriors. I've seen some videos in recent years of people playing this on a whim, and then discovering what a diamond in the rough it truly is. I can't say enough about this game and hope that somehow it gets resurrected. It's a shame that it got a significant amount of negative reviews from some seemingly high profile critics who obviously did not go through the tutorial or read the user manual. If you have the slightest inclination to drive a chariot at high speed while simultaneously engaging in melee weapon combat on the back portion of said chariot, then you seek Circus Maximus: Chariot Wars.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox/circus-maximus-chariot-wars

They're not wrong to do so.Cityscape was developed not by the original Carnivores team, but by Sunstorm Interactive, who developed Primal Prey. This is very apparent from the start as the style of the dinosaurs, the gameplay (right down to the ""decaying corpse"" mechanic), and the sci-fi style weapons are identical to what you'd have expected from a hypothetical ""Primal Prey 2"". There's very little connecting this game to the original Carnivores series, and whenever it tries to bring in the (very short, very simple) lore of those games it somehow manages to always get it wrong.The biggest deviation, obviously, is that this is an FPS rather than a hunting game. Taking the connection to the original games aside, this still seems like a very bad idea. Cityscape does a poor job of competing with other shooters from its time, both graphically and gameplay-wise, and makes poor use of the Serious Sam engine. The game as a whole feels very lazy, with lots of bugs, nonsensical missions, gaping seams in character models and even a level where they didn't even bother to animate the water.The game does offer the unique option to play as a dinosaur, but the concept is so horribly executed that no one in their right mind would ever want to. As a human, the game is playable, but laughably bad and very easy- big guns and thermal goggles ensure that you'll never be outmatched or caught off guard.

I’m with their emergency services ground team and I help train cadets with our cadet program (think JROTC for ages 12-21).  I would not suggest his game for just anyone, but for those who have a desire to go into emergency medicine I can’t suggest it enough.  It is VERY realistic.  The triage, the procedures and equipment.  Even the medication is often exactly the right protocol.  I’ve had cadets who hare gamers, who also wish to become medics and I often suggest this game.  Basically this is to medics what a good flight simulator is to pilots.  Now, if you have no interest in medicine, you’ll probably hate it. Best regards",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/combat-medic-special-ops
