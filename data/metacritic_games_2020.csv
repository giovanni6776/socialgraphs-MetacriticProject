It feels like the best, richest base game Paradox released as of late - plenty of events, stories, traits, combos, skills and features to fiddle with. Each culture brings unique flavours and minor system, each character can spec into one of 5 grand skills that chance the gameplay focus quite a lot and then each of that can specialize further into three branches, each offering unique events, challenges and outcomes. It is not endless by any means, but the depth offered as a start of a surely huge base of DLCs to come it is pretty rich and extensive, so kudos for that - it is, indeed, a time sink you can dig into pretty hard. The accessibility of it piss of some old grumps, because they feel they are loosing their 'Elite' feel with more casual players being able to pick it up, but as a big UX/UI lover, I am delighted to see how they streamlined SO MANY processes, options and info-dumps. Getting all the information you need to make any decision is much easier, the combat is informative, fluid and easy to grasp while still offering quite a bit to fiddle with (Prowess, Knights efficiency, Rock-Paper-Scissor of Men-At-Arms and their terrains bonuses, buildings that improve them in some ways, personal skills of the commanders). Despite that, the game even give you a banal tooltip before moving into combat straightforwardly telling you the chances of losing or winning. It's elegant. It's quick. And easy to step into. Easy to step into should be a tagline for this game. Despite it having layers of stuff to learn and explore (Faith rules and actions, realms laws and management, county upgrades, decisions, court management, vassals management, to name the key ones!) all is laid out as clean as possible, neatly ordered, put together with clever simplicity, almost guiding you to always be able to see what you need to see to play without frustration. It is, by far, the best of their Grand Strategies to begin the adventure with the genre right now. I am tempted to say it is also most forgiving due to the Dyunasty system (you don't lose the game as long as you have a heir to jump onto, so even dramatic loses to the realm ain't a Game Over), but that would be a bit much - the game still offers a steep learning curve that will require your attention, focus and constant rerolling ;)",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/crusader-kings-iii

Two Point Hospital may get compared to Theme Hospital this game stands quite comfortably on it's own 2 feet.  With a different feel and differing mechanics seperating the 2.

Visually the game delivers by the tonne, with nicely designed machines and characters and funny animations. Progression is manageable but not served on a plate, you need to be on your toes to keep everything running smoothly. In what could have been a perfectly sterile review this game for me, has some downsides that was just annoying enough to mention and take that mark down. Firstly, I found myself leaving my seat across to room to be able to read the text on screen, I personally found it small and hard to read, on PC this may have been fine, however on console when people can sit the other side of the room it's an issue. Secondly, you do end up getting fed up of rebuilding the same room, I've had 4 GP offices and still queues tend to be quite long, this can happen with rooms like Pharmacy as well causing a need for multiple pretty quickly before unlocked the next hospital section or finished building other treatment and facility rooms. That aside I believe this is an excellent game for both young and old, Casual / hardcore gamer and an absolute must have for any Theme Hospital fans or fans of Tycoon games, Building Sims.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/two-point-hospital

I'd love to see more of Ben and Dan's puzzle design in the future, it's only gotten better with age... like a fine wine! The sheer amount the game achieves in terms of variety, mechanics, polish (such as lines for a considerable number of random interactions for Ben) is honestly impressive considering how small the core development team is - primarily Dan Marshall and Ben Ward. Their experience from past titles is clear as day with ever evolving adventure game tropes building on BTDT, TGP, and the old adventure games they're such big fans of; smooth platforming mechanics with inspiration from The Swindle, Gun Monkeys, and of course the many indie darling platformers the game regularly pokes fun at (as well as highlighting some of it's best qualities and testing our assumptions of well defined linguistics of the genre a couple of times). There are a few jokes in the game I missed out on, either I'm not old enough to get the reference, or I've not seen the particular game/film/tv show to truly appreciate the punchline - but that's okay, not every joke is going to land with everyone, and the number that stick the landing vastly outweighs those that flew right over my head! I genuinely found myself laughing out loud at home alone to some lines I'll remember for a long time! As a quick round off of some other features - the accessibility options are thorough, clearly a step above from their past titles and even most other games on the market. Whilst the humour might be immature in parts (plenty of poo, bum, and penis jokes) it's never distasteful, and sensitive topics are treated with the respect they deserve (a reflection of Ben and Dan's own growth in the past 10 years no doubt) and poke fun at the negative sources of these remarks rather than the subject matter itself (for example - racists and sexists are the butt of the joke). Whilst the overarching themes of the game might touch upon gloomy, the journey along the way is light-hearted and memorable.There are a couple of aspects of the game that people might not ""get"" or could cause them to think of the game in a poor light but people should give it a chance, there's always more under the surface you're not aware of! Everything has purpose, and Size Five have not overlooked that one bit. Overall the game is an absolute blast, well deserving of all the positive critic and user reviews coming it's way. I would expect in the future this game could become a milestone we look back upon to see where adventure and platforming games are at in the early 2020's. Hopefully we don't have to wait another 10 years for a sequel, but equally if it's as polished, well executed, and consistent as this then I look forward to the sequel in 2030! P.S. If you're reading this and still have any doubt in your mind about whether to buy it, you REALLY should - it deserves a lot more recognition. Plus the additional sales will (hopefully) bring us more of that Ben and Dan design, humour, and fun that we all love.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/lair-of-the-clockwork-god

Let's make one thing clear, this isn't a leap forward in the same sense that WRC 8 was however the net generation is right around the corner and it will be interesting to see what enhancements await with games like dirt 6 Irving soon.. The racing in WRC 9 is surely fantastic. It's still accessible enough that people of all ages can set up and enjoy they game at their desired skill set. It manages this through its improved physics, and just the general feel of the cars handling, as well as how they react to the varying challenges the game brings your way. Fortunately, KT Racing seems to have finally fixed a long-running issue where, even after the slightest of bumps, my car would go flying off like the wright brothers on an early flight attempt. I'm not going to say the car sticks to the road, you'll get some air when needed as this is a rally game after all, but all this is part of the racing and your car responding to the track is a great improvement. About responding to the track, you'll find the game offers great reactions to different surface types and weather conditions. From dirt to gravel, a dry surface, to a soaked surface, or snow, you'll find it genuinely feels different with a change of course or a change of car. When it comes to the awe striking weather effects in WRC 9. You'll find it a lot more challenging and a struggle to stay on course and not find yourself wrapped around the scenery as frequently. Well, you may find yourself wrapping yourself around a surprising obstacle every now and then, particularly when you find a tree for example that's just chilling in the middle of the course? One thorn still there and if I've complained, you're allowed to go a bit off track and if you crash, the game needs to give you more time to recover. By the time I'm recovering myself the game is transporting me back on the track with a stern look on its face and a sharp penalty to my time. WRC 9 is a genuinely beautiful game. From the great shots of light filtering through the lush trees, to the impossibly dark extreme weather events you can find in the campaign. If you turn your lights off, all you can hear is the thunder of the torrential rain on your roof and the crash as you hit the wall you couldn't see after spinning out after aquaplaning. The only issue you may find is if you look too closely at the spectators or some backgrounds, the same quality isn't always apparent. However, you're not meant to be focusing on them, you're meant to be zipping past at 200 miles per hour to the winners cup. At least that's how the engines sound, well, if you're going that fast. The audio is on the same level as the visuals. WRC 9 is yet another step ahead for the WRC series from previous installments. However, unlike last year's outing which was a massive leap, this seems to be content to simply refine. In keeping with that the visuals , audio, general racing improvement, as well as improved physics. There are a few bugs but nothing game breaking in the least. There's no doubt that WRC 9 is a strong contender and should certainly be on the list for anybody who wants a great rally game for their Xbox One and Xbox Series S/X in a few months time.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/wrc-9-fia-world-rally-championship

My only problem with the game is that some of the levels feel a little similar, but the feel the music provides minimizes this problem very dramatically. The smallest and simplest of elements make a world of difference, like how you can grab enemies, which also gets rid of the level similarity. The voice cast is also amazing. Nolan North, John DiMaggio, Sam Riegel, Eric Bauza and James Dirschberger do a fantastic job in all of their roles and add an extra layer of comedy to the game and its story. Something that must be commended is the constant communication between players and the developer.

Zangetsu must battle his way to the demonic stronghold, but he doesn't have to do it alone! Zangetsu can ally himself with a brand new cast of characters he meets along the way and add them to the playable roster. Each new character adds a variety of gameplay options, abilities, and ways to complete the game's many stages. Game FlowBattle through stages filled with fearsome enemies and dangerous traps, each with a massive boss waiting at the end. A chance encounter with a potential ally awaits you after defeating a boss. Will they serve as a trustworthy partner on your perilous journey? Increase Combat AbilitiesYou can instantaneously switch between allies you have recruited at any time! Allies have their own life bars, so with each ally you recruit, you're survivability is greatly increased! Shortcuts that Only Allies Can AccessAllies have special, unique abilities which allow them to use shortcuts to skip parts of stages or access new areas! There are no special items obtainable by taking the long way around, so take every shortcut you can find! If your allies are out of commission, you'll have to take longer routes, where stronger enemies await! When your life gets low, be sure to switch then out so they'll be available when you need them. Multiple EpisodesThe story is told over the course of multiple episodes. Only the first episode is accessible at the beginning, but more episodes will unlock as you progress through the game. The events that unfold in each episode continue into the next one, so be sure to unlock all the episodes to see the true ending. Curse of the Moon 2 had two play styles, ""Veteran"" and ""Casual"". Veteran StyleChoose ""Veteran"" style to experiment a difficulty reminiscent of older games.

The original character art is by JJ Grandville, a French artist from the same time the game is set, and the music by Saint-Saens and Tchaikovsky has been chosen with great care. It makes me really happy that the little caricatural animal designs have been brought to life with so much thought into an original, cohesive story. All aspects in terms of design and style in the game feel incredibly authentic - historical references are infused within its remastered ink drawings, making the game feel modern yet profoundly refreshing in its immersion with the past.I'd highly recommend reading the dialogue aloud (which is delightfully witty and funny), as, like poetry, the characters and story become even more alive. They are so full of charm and it is all too easy to feel emotionally attached - the depth in the characters is fantastic.For example Cocorico the uptight prosecutor - you at first feel he is just a shallow law-abider who thinks law should dictate and underpin every action - very self-righteous, arrogant, and pretentious.

Lets you play this game in any order youd like.. the variety and charm within this world is Mario galaxy level.. it never stops being fun and I wish so bad the rest of the games hubs were this varied and fun, phogs could’ve been close to masterpiece status if that were the case, here youll be playing through arcage games, playing mini golf, playing tennis with the worlds boss… The beach world is Nintendo level good and it what ultimately makes phogs am ust have game…While there clearly isa section of levels tha steals the show for me, there is so much fun and even frustration to be had with PHOGS!, one of the greatest surprises of the year.I give PHOGS!an 8/10",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/phogs!

I died a little over 30 times throughout me 5 hour journey, and id say that probably over 20 of thise deaths came at the hand of not tilting the right direction on the carts, getting smacking with too many boxes as I feel through a portal… and these didn’t feel like fun quick time frustrations, these moments felt cheap and annoying, I dreading the moments I had to jump and dodge on a cart.. mostly be casue these are decently lengthy sections with no checkpoints… but after they were done it was back to the fun..

Soy fanático de los juegos de horror y puedo decir con certeza que VISAGE es uno de los mejores juegos de horror que he jugado en está generación. VISAGE es un juego survival horror muy difícil, después de una introducción muy perturbadora, debes explorar la casa donde vives y desenmarañar la trama, el protagonista sufre de miedo a la oscuridad, cuando permaneces en lugares oscuros comienzas  a perder la cordura (Representada por un cerebro), cuando esto ocurre suceden hechos paranormales, para evitarlos, debes medicarte y permanecer en la luz para que tu cordura regrese, a medida que avanzas van sucediendo sucesos paranormales de manera aleatoria que dificultan está tarea. En el juego no hay combate, sólo debes huir de las diferentes entidades que enfrentas, mientras vas resolviendo los muchos puzzles que el juego plantea. Desde el primer contacto, el juego va construyendo un miedo genuino, miedo que va creciendo poco a poco, hasta calar en lo más profundo de la mente, este juego te hace entender de verdad lo que es el terror psicologico, todo el tiempo te sientes abrumado por una sensación de inquietud, la cual el juego logra con su excelente ambientación, escenarios fotorealistas y sucesos paranormales que ocurren de manera aleatoria durante la partida. No recomendaría jugarlo en un día que te sientes mal, ya que el juego es bastante abrumador con las sensaciones que puede transmitir. Recomiendo jugarlo de noche, solo y con audifonos, yo lo jugué en un televisor con full array y va genial. Como puntos negativos, son 2, el primero se relaciona con el inventario, su gestión es nefasta, ya que si tienes el inventario lleno y quieres tomar un ítem, debes soltar el ítem que llevas en la mano para tomar el nuevo, lo cual a la larga se hace un poco molesto, recomiendo siempre dejar por lo menos 1 espacio vacío en el inventario para que esto no ocurra, creo que está gestión se pudo haber llevado mejor, el primer contacto es difícil, pero después te acostumbras. El segundo punto negativo, es que hay un nivel en particular, que no te dan objetos para iluminar y es demasiado oscuro, por lo cual no podía ver mucho, tuve que subir el brillo a la tv, igual podríamos decir que hay ciertos acertijos complicados y un poco rebuscados, si eres poco observador quizás quedes pegado mucho rato en un lugar, recomiendo revisar hasta el último cajón y no te quedes pegado en un acertijo. Para finalizar, sólo diré que recomiendo este juego ampliamente para los amantes del survival horror, es un juego muy destacable que merece mucho más reconocimiento, por otra parte, si eres una persona poco paciente, que se frustra rápido o que no soporta sensaciones muy fuertes no te recomiendo VISAGE.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/visage

Lets you play this game in any order youd like.. the variety and charm within this world is Mario galaxy level.. it never stops being fun and I wish so bad the rest of the games hubs were this varied and fun, phogs could’ve been close to masterpiece status if that were the case, here youll be playing through arcage games, playing mini golf, playing tennis with the worlds boss… The beach world is Nintendo level good and it what ultimately makes phogs am ust have game…While there clearly isa section of levels tha steals the show for me, there is so much fun and even frustration to be had with PHOGS!, one of the greatest surprises of the year.I give PHOGS!an 8/10",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/phogs!

They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously “anti-gravitated” gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields.

But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story.

It's the little things that bother me as I have always found the Ride franchise to be the weakest in Milestone's catalog while still remaining strong overall. There are many motorcycles missing that were previously in Ride 2. Overall the bugs in the game are limited thanks to an early patch. What I do find somewhat strange is that while driving and you look at the motorcycle from the side, you see several rear tires offset one behind the other possibly to give a shadow effect? The seams of the gloves also glow excessively in neon green or yellow, which takes away from the realism. They just need to have a very slight yellow tinge. As far as the sound, you can tell from some sounds from which motorcycles they could be, but many of them just sound very generic in style. Unfortunately, I can also say something negative about the driving physics as in the other games in the franchise. While playing the highest simulation level, I can hardly crash some bikes in a high lean angle and full throttle, which is obviously unrealistic being in full on simulation. With ABS off and the wheels also hardly lock up. You can't crash a wheelie by giving too much throttle and you can’t brake too much when doing a stoppie either. The AI has definitely improved this time around, but it may be too realistic for some players, because you can easily make too many mistakes. In nearly every race the AI rams into you with a lot of speed. The Milestone signature rewind function also makes its way to Ride 4, no big surprise there so that's a plus for players who want to play in simulation without too much worry or frustration in the end. In general, it's fun to drive around with the motorcycles, especially because there are no real alternatives to the Ride franchise. Ride 4 like the rest of the franchise I feel are a bit over on the price of admission for the overall content of the game. For me, even as Ride is Milestone's weakest franchise as I mentioned earlier it's still a great game. I may have pointed out a lot of negatives but there are all the Ride positives in place as well for fans of the franchise. If you enjoy motorcycle games or Milestone's franchises in general you should defintely enjoy what Ride 4 has to offer you for your Xbox One and upcoming Xbox Series X library.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/ride-4

However, it does it well enough to keep your interest until the end. It's not the deepest combat system ever–in fact, the comparisons to Devil May Cry are greatly exaggerated, and the combat in Super Crush feels more like a simplified version of Guacamelee. While the combat system isn't deep, however, it's good fun. And it has to be, because Super Crush has nothing else to offer: there is no difficult environment to navigate, no secrets to find (as far as I could tell), and no plot twists. It's just moving from right to left, punching and kicking a reasonable variety of robotic baddies. Super Crush K.O. is small in scope, but it has been carefully crafted. The graphics ooze charm and pastel-colored happiness, and the silly manga-flavoured teen story brought a smile to my face. The key idea behind the story is amusing in itself: every cat owner in the world thinks that her cat is the cutest in the universe–but the game's protagonist is actually right in that belief, and her cat gets kidnapped by an alien teenager for that exact reason. That light-hearted premise is essentially the whole story of the game, and it makes for some amusing dialogue and interludes. Like most combo-based games, Super Crush K.O. invites you to revisit completed levels in search of a better ranking, or a higher position on the online leaderboards. I'd have appreciated some extra content, like a harder New Game+, or a few hidden levels–but even though this game is short in length and narrow in scope, I ended up loving every minute of it.

You can never build a perfect deck.

Another way to describe it is, if you have ever had a fight with someone you care about where you want to be understood but nothing you say is working and understanding is something you cannot reach in the moment... that is this whole game! There are no meaningless interactions, everything matters! Every conversation can be innocuous but also every conversation can feel like a boss battle.

The premise is simple, classic turn based RPG combat with some roguelike elements. I am sucker for turn based strategy and turn based tactics games, so this was right up my alley. The audio and visuals in this game are stellar. Nice music and sound effects, though one or two more background music pieces would be nice. The graphics are a dream; old school 16 bit style with beautiful animations. Each character and enemy has wonderful color and detail, and their movements are unique and satisfying. The gameplay is fantastic. Like I said before, old school turn based RPG combat. It does have some new spins to it; you can interrupt enemy attacks if you plan your attacks appropriately, and you can unlock combo attacks for your characters if you improve their ""relationship meter"" with each other. There is a sort of minigame that breaks up the combat, where you play cards that give your characters combat boosts. Playing a character's card on another character boosts their relationship, and upon leveling up their relationship enough, you can confer stat bonuses, unlock a combo attack, and in some cases unlock new characters permanently. Speaking of permanently, the roguelike elements of the game involve unlocking new items that then become available in subsequent playthroughs, as well as alternate setups for the characters, providing them with slightly different stats and maybe one or two different abilities. It's lighter than what would be considered a full roguelike in that you can actually beat the game your first playthrough; these upgrades are not necessary for completion. They do make it much easier though. All together, these elements work somehow. Another point I want to address is how good the game stability is. There are virtually no bugs. This game released in an excellent state; I played maybe a good 50 hours before encountering one or two audio/visual issues, but nothing that affected gameplay or caused crashing/freezing. The couple of minor bugs that did arise have been patched promptly. This is such a welcome departure from what has unfortunately become the norm in the gaming industry. Too many game developers release games in haphazard states and then halfheartedly fix their crappy games over the course of weeks or maybe even months. I'm looking at you Wasteland 3. The fact that these guys did not do this is so refreshing. There are a couple of negatives to Star Renegades. To start, the story is non-existent. The premise is interesting, but beyond setting the stage there is nothing else. This is disappointing for me, because a strong story will keep me invested in a game that is otherwise subpar. Thankfully the gameplay more than compensates for me. Another negative is the simplicity of the achievements. They are woefully simple, as in kill this type of enemy a million times, complete the game X times. They are extremely grindy and feel tacked on. I honestly don't give a **** about getting all of a game's achievements, but I do like to go for the ones that seem interesting or challenging. There are none of those here. The biggest drawback for me is the game's map. In between fights you navigate around an area map, picking up items and choosing your next battles. At best, the map is fiddly. At worst, it is convoluted and frustrating. It is difficult to actually click to other sections of the map, and for no reason really. Also, as you play through an area, sections of the map become locked. So you have to plan your route as you fight. However, sometimes there are sections of the map that lock without you having any way to access them in the first place, so what's the point of that? Also, you're constantly having to scroll around the map because you can't see the whole thing at once; there isn't even a temporary zoom out feature to get your bearings. I almost reduced my rating by a point just because of the map functionality, or lack thereof. Ultimately, I kept my score at a 10 because, despite the obtuse map and lack of story, I have put a good 120 hours into this game, and I will most likely put more hours in. The combat is incredibly satisfying for me; it scratches that turn based combat itch in an undeniably satisfying way for me. If you are a fan of turn based games, if you like SNES style graphics, this game deserves your time.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/star-renegades

Many city builders offer quests but they're typically arbitrary and lame.

Lets you play this game in any order youd like.. the variety and charm within this world is Mario galaxy level.. it never stops being fun and I wish so bad the rest of the games hubs were this varied and fun, phogs could’ve been close to masterpiece status if that were the case, here youll be playing through arcage games, playing mini golf, playing tennis with the worlds boss… The beach world is Nintendo level good and it what ultimately makes phogs am ust have game…While there clearly isa section of levels tha steals the show for me, there is so much fun and even frustration to be had with PHOGS!, one of the greatest surprises of the year.I give PHOGS!an 8/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/phogs!

I loved the Open world, although it can be confusing. In my playthrough this didn't matter, because it only took me 4 days to complete it. During these days I could develope a pretty good map in my head, so the only time I was lost was when I first entered each area. The missing map and the safety of the spaceship due to being pretty much the only pause function and safepoint in the game really immersed me into the role of a space explorer.The satiric part of the game is sometimes a subtle comment of your KI companion EKO, and sometimes a super funny video or email. The videos especially are bad in a good way. The best thing is the computer's loading screen though.Unlocking new upgrades was always a joy and they were always integrated in a way, that didn't stop you from exploring too much. The only exception were the two last ones.And the platforming - it felt awesome to jump around with the cool air control upgrades in the late game. With the world consisting of vertical or flying surroundings, this makes backtracking a lot faster and easier.Oh right. Backtracking. As a completionist I enjoy getting things and having them all. I do NOT enjoy searching things. Thankfully this game didn't make me do that, since it had helpful tools. Although having 100 orange goo, 32 upgrade materials, 18 lore objects, 10 fuel tanks and 196 scans to collect, it was never endless searching, nor was it running from one waypoint to the other.All in all it took me nearly 20 hours for only 30€. Stretching this game wouldn't have been a good idea. The number one reason I enjoyed this game so much, was because there was always something fresh and new. 10 additional hours would not have preserved this feeling. So I think this length is perfectly fine. If you love Sci-Fi, exploring, platforming and a little bit of Douglas Adams - go buy that game.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/journey-to-the-savage-planet

I could feel a slight lag with the inputs and moving to the another scenery/screen, the transition was a little too slow. I could expect this from 1987 Mac/PC, but modern consoles should run this kind of video game smoothly. I got used to the controls and the lag fairly quickly and the right-timing-requiring jumps. The melee fighting and gun shooting also demanded timing management. I always remembered the little lag, so in the end I couldn’t be bothered about it. Along the game I got new stuff, like better shoes to run faster and other gimmicks to help my journey. In the beginning I died a lot! It was very much learning how to kill and use the environment, there seemed to be more than one way to solve things. The enemies had well-made AI and they did react differently, depending situations. That was something I took seriously, before approaching enemies. THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE:I have very little to say about the plot, other than it becomes more clear in the end. In the beginning I could read a long summary about the plot, but the text was mostly unreadable, due the pixel mush font. The main character crash-lands his spaceship in a mysterious planet and needs to collect parts, so he can fix the ship and leave. He goes into a “castle” and immediately runs to enemies. Some of them could kill him with one hit. Yes, then I realized how ruthless this game is gonna be! The story was interesting and I was always happy of all given little hints and writings of the happenings of that place. A VISUAL SHOWSTOPPER:I was fascinated how the game looked visually. Graphics done by 2-bit CGA -style, still managing to show depth and feeling of 3D world. The Eternal Castle is, as they claim, very action-movie-like. All the visual effects were stunning to watch and managed to create the suspence and wonderment. It’s odd to think how using only 2-bits can create so much. I always searched the most odd and difficult route, since as a gamer, I know there are usually something hidden in those places. Keeping player intrigued, the surroundings hid lots of secrets behind the dark shadows and backgrounds to be find. The graphics had a slight downfall, them being messy at times and hard to look at. I missed some items only due to the fact I didn’t see them soon enough. But, I can easily forgive that, because the replaybility value is very high (The Eternal Castle is meant to be replayed many times). It also includes 2-player co-op mode. The remastered audio and background music were nice to listen — and not some annoying peeping, like one could expect from a 80’s video game. The Eternal Castle had lots of checkpoints, there was few areas where I needed them badly, because after death player can continue from the latest checkpoint, which sometimes was far away. I was pleased how some of the progress was saved after dying. It truly made the gameplay little easier this way. REPEATING THE HISTORY:I don’t know the full origin story of The Eternal Castle, but according to the internet, it seems to be a big deal in video game history. It definitely rised the bar amongst the video game developers back in 1987, surely leaving everyone gaggin’ for more — probably now repeating the history. The Eternal Castle being now available on Nintendo Switch; I truly recommend everyone to try out this amazing remastered piece of history.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/the-eternal-castle-remastered

I play so many horror games, and watch so much horror it all starts to just run together and not be very memorable. Infliction is just the opposite, it's like when you come across that unexpected great horror movie, and you can't wait to tell people about it. The moment I started it I just knew it was different and special. The first person camera, and design of your home really pulls you into the game. You start to see so many items laying around the home that you can just relate to. Just a lot of films, games, food items , etc just really make you feel like this is your every day home and family. There are so many nods to classic and epic films and games as well. This really added a lot to the game as well for me. It almost felt like the first time I played ""Gone Home"" A really eerie vibe from the start. Where ""Gone Home"" actually goes a totally different way ""Infliction"" does not. You are right to feel scared and uneasy because the horror is very much coming your way.I don't want to give away a lot of the story, because I also feel I gave away a little to much in my video review with the footage. You play a man coming home to look for tickets for your wife. You make your way through your normal home seeing things the typical family would see every day. Your daughters poster covered walls, and beautiful art hung by your beautiful wife.It really brings you in making you feel at home, then delivers Hell right to your door step. This game is really scary. The unease it puts you at not knowing what is coming your way is just horror perfection. It throws you into it when you least expect it as well. The main ghost will just haunt you long after you finish this game. I was checking to see if I locked my door on, and turned on a couple lights in my home after as well. The ghost is relentless there are ways to avoid her, and stop her but I'm not telling you. You can figure that out for your self. I think that is one of the most fun parts of the game, and some reviewers my spoil that for you for a few extra lines in their review, but I'm not doing it.There are other monsters that are creepy as well, I'm glad there is more than just one, and when they aren't terrifying you the environments will as well. Things change in your home, and your also taking to other places as well that will scare you just as much as the creatures in this game. They will set you up with the unease of the things around you before the real threats arrive . I was sucked into this game from the start, and just couldn't stop playing. I played it from start to finish. I know I will be going back to it as well. I will also be looking up other people's finds to see things I might have missed.Infliction: Extended Cut is a must own for horror fans. I was so glad to get a review copy for this. Horror has been kind of a let down of late in gaming. This certainly is not. This is with out question the best horror game of 2020. I hope more horror is on the way from Caustic reality , I hope more horror games are on the way as a whole in 2020 there just isn't enough quality ones. If you feel the same Infliction is the horror game for you. It is scary from start to finish. it never feels repetitive, and it just puts you on the edge of your seat until the final credits roll. Pros:Realistic and Scary EnvironmentsGreat StoryNot just a bunch of jump scaresExcellent MonstersLoaded with tributes to classic horror and gaming Cons:None Overall: 9.0Infliction is the horror game I been waiting for for awhile. The one that makes you turn a light on and check your doors are locked. The horror game that really pulls you in, and keeps you terrified until it's over and maybe even a little while after it's over.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/infliction-extended-cut

It is not a ""Triple A"", latest graphics, big bang boom shoot em up where you can take a series of bullets, spin around and bunny hop to no scope kill the guy who tactically saw you first.  Nope. This is an ultra realistic and unforgiving WW1 tactical FPS shooter made by an indie staff of roughly 10 people.  What this small group has done is make an insanely authentic WW1 game that offers a very different experience than other shooters with just enough pieces from other games that you will be able to pick it up and know ""how to play"" despite the multiple layers of meta under the hood you may or may not discover later (psst, you should!). These gents are the ones that made Verdun (also on console and pc) and with both games they painstakingly made sure every rifle, grenade, bayonet, shovel, uniforms etc are authentic to the time, country and squad that used it.  I cant imagine the amount of wonderfully appreciated nerd time that took!  Instead of BF1 where you might have a machine gun, some grenades, a pistol, mortar launcher, melee weapon with an exploding crossbow on your back...in this game, you just might end up being the guy in the sqaud who only gets 3 grenades and a shovel...yeah, thats right, a freegin shovel!  lol.  It doesnt tell you you are a one man army, it tells you you might want to stick to your squad and try to be invisible until you get to a cap zone or trench near it.  What I love about Tanneberg over Verdun is the map is now a big tactical chess board where a good NCO and squad can move from point to point with the care and teamwork you thought you would see more of in BF1.  Sometimes you will still have that choatic feel where everyone looks like theyre just running around and dying, but the higher level potential is there in this one and it shows and shines when it happens.  Every step and move must be much more calculated or you WILL end up shot to the ground and be faced with a ""killed by"" screen where they wont let you see where you were even shot from.  Teamwork and communication is huge with this one. Overall, id say this, if you played BF1 (which i loved and still do mind you) and always wanted things to lean more on the real side (and enjoyed ""back to basics"" game mode with iron sights) ill go out on a limb and say you will enjoy the hell out of Tannenberg. Theres a few reasons I didnt give it 10/10.   One reason is a lack of spectator mode (which is on the PC versions). The lack of the ability to change the controls to make the right stick crouch (which i solved with my Elite controller setup, but).  Strangely absent also is the ability to invite a friend to join you easily via a button.  You can still do it via joining same game or squad, or squad up first, but no invite from a match etc.  Seems a quick easy patch for all these things, but im reviewing it as is, the day after release.  They also have some general engine improvements and tweaking needs (that they have improved on for years with this engine).  For me, if these things were addressed, 10/10. Overall the game is much more than I expected and im enjoying it more that I hoped which is excellelent!  Its getting addicting to hear my gear jostle again while I try to survive from point A to B with very different things to consider than Verdun. The crisp clear sounds of clean iron sight one shot rifle kills have never been more satisfying in a game.  ;)",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/tannenberg

It has multiple problems stemming from the physics, AI and boost system that hold it back. Lack of ContentOne common complaint I saw was the amount of content at launch. A lot of the original game modes were scrapped, mostly likely due to their reliance on the weapons to make them function properly. This left the game with a lot less content than it was originally supposed to have. Due to this, the game had an anemic launch with only four tournaments and four gamemodes. Thankfully, it seems like we will be getting additional free updates to add more content, with the newest Big Boss update adding in a new tournament, a new gamemode and four new tracks. Lackluster Track DesignWhile Hotshot Racing’s tracks look amazing, their design is very lacking. All the tracks are very flat and way more simple than other arcade racers. I couldn’t understand this at first, but then it hit me: these maps were originally designed with the vehicular combat in mind. In a weaponized combat racer, it's better to have more flat and less complex tracks for the weapons to be usable. With the weapons now gone, it draws a lot more attention to the basic map design. While I don’t think they should change the tracks we have now, they should consider making more vertical and complex maps for the future. Floaty Vehicle PhysicsSomething just doesn’t feel right with the vehicle handling in this game. I believe the issue mainly stems from the floaty driving physics. I noticed that when taking corners, my wheels would lift off the ground on relatively flat surfaces. This completely throws off the vehicle handling when it happens. While I feel like the vehicle handling and drifting mechanics itself needs to be worked on more, I would like to see how much better they would be if vehicles had way more downforce. Combative AI & Bad Collision PhysicsRegarding the AI, they are WAY too combative. They hit, smash, and spin me like I’m playing a Burnout game. Seriously, I played vehicular combat games that have less aggressive AI than this. It wouldn’t be so bad if the collision physics were good, but they suck. Many times your car will lift off the ground when getting hit, causing the same vehicle handling problems I mentioned beforehand. Also, sometimes you don’t get affected at all and other times you are sent heading straight for a wall. For a game that demands perfect precision and control from the player, it’s out of control AI and terrible collision physics makes the racing way more frustrating than it should be. AI RubberbandingThe rubberbanding is another huge problem. Rather than it being that hardcoded rubberbanding, where the AI increases their top speed to catch up, it seems to be moreso a problem stemming from how the boost system works. The boost works by giving you a huge increase of speed when you fill up one of the bars. The only way to get boost is either from drifting or slipstreaming other cars. It seems pretty standard, but the problem is when you pull out in front, you can’t slipstream any cars, meaning you can only get boost from drifting. This leaves you vulnerable in long straights as the AI behind you have been slipstreaming you or each other to build up enough boost to continually pass you. This also means that if you fall way behind, it can be extremely hard to catch back up. The game essentially encourages you not to get to the front but rather stay behind the leaders until the very end. This issue could be easily fixed by not giving boost from slipstreaming, but rather just giving enough of a speed boost to pass a player. Overall, Hotshot Racing is a mixed experience. I can’t not recommend it as all these issues combine to make Hotshot Racing a wildly inconsistent and frustrating experience. With more updates planned in the future, I hope one day I can say Hotshot Racing feels perfect, but it still got a long way to go.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/hotshot-racing

They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously “anti-gravitated” gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields. As the player progresses towards more complex puzzles, they will encounter other devices - magnetic plates, elevators, buttons or even drones capable of nullifying magnetic and gravitational fields as well as stealing cubes.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/relicta

The graphics aren't brilliant - the Switch port definitely took a hit there - but you can only really tell when zoomed in on the buildings. Otherwise, from far away, it looks fine. The music is a jam too, and the controls are simple with a wheel of choices which works wonderfully for the Switch.In terms of gameplay, there are two main modes: Missions, which are scenarios taking place on different maps and tasking you in different areas, with regular gameplay elements such as demands, dealing with factions, etc. and Sandbox, which lets you pick the map and fully customise elements of your game before ruling with an iron fist. There's also the Tutorial, which includes multiple chapters and detailed tasks to teach you the basics of the game. Some mechanics aren't fully explained, but there's enough there to grasp how to play the game effectively, especially when faced with the Missions.There are some issues - I experienced a crash in the first tutorial which occurred pretty frequently. I was able to fix it myself by doing the steps the tutorial asked of me first before the task popped up (just take a screenshot of the task before the game crashes and then do it after) which was annoying but oh well. There's also the loading times - they are pretty long compared to other versions, maybe about a minute or so. I've also heard complaints about the DLC not being included in the main package, especially with the price when compared to the PC version, but there's enough included in the main game that I personally don't think it's an issue. Just worth mentioning in case that's an issue for some. Overall what you're getting here is a great strategy game. It has got some issues in terms of graphics, some infrequent crashes and long loading times, but overall there's tons of content here and plenty to keep your strategic mind occupied. Come on, El Presidente - you've an archipelago to rule and your console can come too!Final Score: 8/10",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/tropico-6

Another story tinged with horror and sci fi elements. Another trip into the uncomfortable territory of violating simulated people’s privacy for a good cause. This sequel sticks pretty close to the footsteps of its predecessor. This time, the justification is justice, because the owner of the phone is quite dead, and you might be a cop, or a cop's little journalist helper. That makes the whole endeavour a bit less creepy, even though the characters of the story and the protagonist himself express a whole lot of disapproval of the invasion of privacy aspect of the proceedings. Gameplay-wise, things have been improved and deepened quite a lot. There is now a mechanic where you can store facts that you have discovered as a kind of file on the phone, and use them to confront people with them via chat. The simulations of social hacking have been implemented more gracefully and more challenging. The FMV production values have gone up, the inevitable creepy pasta is quite a bit creepier. So if Simulacra 2 is a whole lot more of Simulacra, and I found Simulacra quite compelling and mostly fun to play, then I must have enjoyed playing Simulacra 2, right? Unfortunately, no, I didn’t. There were a few minor snags: Some of the riddles you have to puzzle out were very obscure, and, to my mind, there was way too much dross to sift through to find the few nuggets of usable information within the timelines of the various social media apps on the phone. But the main reason I felt little enjoyment while playing were the characters. The game’s main four characters are influencers, and as a consequence, they are a bunch of miserable, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, morally compromised people. That's not my framing, that is the inescapable implication of the script. I can’t find a single ounce of sympathy with any of these people even though their life is in danger and the plot tries, unsuccesfully, to redeem them in the end. There is no self-reflection, nothing is learned. Seriously, if I ever want to warn someone away from this career path, I'll have him or her play this game. The cringe is that intense. I admit this might be a me thing, because I look with deepening horror at this business of turning your own life into a product. But I do believe that you can not play this game without developing a distaste for an Influencer's existence. Staring into an abyss can be compelling or even fun, eyeballing these particular depths was not fun for me. Only play this if misery porn is your thing. TLDR: An OK horror story combined with an honest look into one of the creepiest and extensively miserable facets of online existence. This is an acquired taste, and I have failed acquiring it.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/simulacra-2

Those two things are all that anyone does, unless it’s a limited weekend where the cards aren’t good enough to consistently do them, then you have a chance at getting real basketball. The post game is pretty much unusable unless you are a stick shooter, which by the way makes for a huge zen problem where people use modded controllers to win every game online. Post hooks are super OP with the stick, but hooks, fades, dropsteps, etc are hard to do in game. Finishing is pretty much running at the barleys and hoping for a good animation, euro steps, spins, hop steps, floaters, and double clutches are practically useless. Shooting is a whole other issue, some players will make every single shot and some will miss every shot, it’s incredibly random at times unless you can get a team of guys that you know the releases of. As a NMS MyTeam guy, the door is always revolving, so it’s hard to learn new releases every few games. MyTeam is still a cash grab, attempting to force people into buying packs for the best cards, although it is better than its Madden counterpart, with actual budget players who can legitimately compete with the best cards in the game in the hands of a skilled player (a la Nick Anderson earlier in the year). As for myleague, I have encountered numerous glitches and bugs, mostly from downloading older rosters, taking over all 30 teams, etc. I encountered a glitch where random played in the league would have their stats messed up, like one time I had Ja win most improved player after averaging nearly the same stats as the year before, but when I looked at the stats from the year before, which was his second year, it said he averaged 2 points for the Hawks, when I know he was on the Grizzlies and averaged about 19 points. This happened to a lot of players around the league. I also encounter glitched with classic rosters where players don’t age, or don’t regress, sometimes the court turns completely black as do the players when I jump into games, sometimes I’ll jump into a game and a team will be running a 5 big man lineup, this happens a lot actually. Sometimes 86 overalls will sign for the minimum contract because they don’t sign in the offseason, there is no voter fatigue, tendencies are very inaccurate, auto generated draft classes are not balanced at all, injuries are too frequent, teams sign and draft way too many players at one position while neglecting the rest of the positions, cpu trades are very rarely meaningful, often times it’s just a player at a position with a certain overall being traded for another player at the exact same position with the exact same overall, it feels like the trade just to trade, with no meaning.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nba-2k21

Questo a volte inficia la visibilità della protagonista, ma in realtà la situazione rimane sempre sotto controllo. GAMEPLAY:Come già detto il gioco è di base molto simile ad altri titoli. Si sviluppa a scorrimento orizzontale ma senza molte sezioni platform e soprattutto l'ambiente è tridimensionale, quindi dovremo stare attenti anche agli elementi sullo sfondo. I soli comandi di salto e presa bastano per creare abbastanza situazioni interessanti lungo l'intero sviluppo del gioco, lungo circa 3 ore. Gli enigmi ambientali sono difficili il giusto da capire, ma alcuni sono piuttosto ostici da realizzare per colpa dei nemici. Sono inoltre presenti diversi segreti, molto ben nascosti in quanto il primo l'ho trovato solo a gioco inoltrato (mi stavo chiedendo come mai non ci fossero segreti, visto che sono frequenti in questo genere). STORIA:Il gioco non ha una vera e propria storia, cosa che in questo genere si può accettare, però i cambi di ambientazione sono completamente illogici e atti solo a permettere certe situazioni. Non ho apprezzato come il gioco sembra voler trasmettere un messaggio, a me ignoto, ma fallisca nel farlo e per provare a farlo rovini anche la coerenza delle ambientazioni. Devo dire però che ogni singola ambientazione è pensata molto bene, con vari elementi e nemici specifici, tutto molto diversi e abbastanza originali. In conclusione, consiglio il gioco agli amanti del genere perché dura poco ed è piacevole, ma una volta provato Inside si capiscono tutti i limiti di Stela. VOTO: 7.5/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/stela

This title really took me back to the fun I had on there playing with random people on Xbox live. I kind of struggled to find people playing on the XBOX version which kind of sucks. Tons of people play and stream the PC version though so if your looking for tons of people to play with I might recommend on there instead. I had to search European servers to find people to play on XBOX. On there I was able to get a nice game of 6 going online. It is possible to play with up to 12 though. If you have a lot of friends you play with on LIVE be fun to get some full games going especially since it’s currently on Game Pass. I figure most people will have a blast playing with their friends even if they don’t like golf. Every one loves mini golf, and all the cool obstacles you come across on the courses. let’s talk a little about those. There are tons of cool decoration and obstacles through out the many , many levels. Things like Dinosaurs, Knights who chop with axes, to portals. I could go on and on talking about these. There is also many of powerups like anti gravity, jet packs, and ability to bounce on water. This game is going to make you play it over and over to master these courses. If you want to be competitive online your going to play this a ton learning every course. There are so many of them that the replay almost feels limitless. Levels like Space Stations, Deserts, Candy Lands, Museums, Haunted Houses, and so many more. This is one of those games you are going to invest a huge amount of time into, and at $20 your really gonna feel your getting way more of your money’s worth out of this one. Not only are you going to invest time into learning it, but also into unlocking it’s many customization items. You can unlock tons and tons of hats for your ball, ball trails, and even change the color of your ball. Like I said replay galore. I know the title is Golf with Friends, but I actually played this a lot alone as well. I had just the same level of enjoyment playing it solo unlocking Achievements and learning courses. You still get a score for the levels so you can try and beat your previous scores while you learn as well. So I could highly recommend this to people who don’t like playing online, and don’t have that competitive edge. It’s really relaxing listening to the quality music that seems to fit each level perfectly while you make your way through 18 holes. I can honestly say this is the most fun I’ve had with a golf game in years. I really hope to find a bunch of people who play this on the regular to enjoy it with. Look forward to mastering the courses, and the shot meter to where I’m dominating people online. Hopefully see some of you guys and gals there.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/golf-with-your-friends

A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.* Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.* Explore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board.

Nothing spectacular though Bad:- it may look like a tycoon game to you at first, where you need to optimize your decisions and strive to keep the food supply sufficient, the mood high etc. However, by year 5 the farm just falls apart through no fault of yours. And by year 6 there are no available actions left apart form ""sing"" and ""cheer"". I had to drop the game when, in year 6, the game literally showed no available actions. That's effectively game end.- the game totally fails to deliver the book's message, or any message at all. E.g. I've managed to build the windmill but then human neighbors attacked the farm, and destroyed the windmill. Given that story, one would have to say that the USSR was a great country and only failed because the evil West attacked it or at least strangled it with sanctions and the nuclear threat. Ridiculous. Similarly, by day 5 there were simply no animals remaining who would want to do any work. Hens, sheep, cows - these all just weren't on the yard anymore and couldn't be assigned tasks. The last animal to do any work (planting seeds) was actually a pig! Which totally contradicts the book's idea that pigs became lazy and never did any work- animals are constantly ""tired'. This begs the question: ""if they are constantly tired now when they don't need to feed a human, how didn't they get mortally tired when a human was exploiting them?""- there are plot inconsistencies. E.g. I let the dogs run away on day 3. Still, on day 6 the story mentions dogs arresting the Clower horse.- for many actions, the result is unclear, and the action itself is just one word. I didn't bother to reload and just tried those actions out to see what they do. This all made the gameplay feel random and meaningless. I'd say that the designers of this game took an impossible task: to take a political book with a linear story and turn it into something that, at least to a gamer, looks like a tycoon or farm management game.  The thing is, tycoon games ARE about central planning, just on a scale of a single company (run authoritatively by a CEO, in an environment of a free market economy). But this game has to ""prove that communism is bad"" by cheating against the player and forcing him to fail. Oh yeah, and just to be clear: I'm a Russian, and I still remember the USSR as a child. And I've read the ""Animal Farm"" book a few times: first time at school and then a couple times in English as an adult. And I hate communism. And I run my own business and hate all the leftist madness that's plaguing the West right now. Gee, what a mess of a game.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/orwells-animal-farm

The lack of combat is a good thing. Many games try to shoe horn combat in because ""it's required"". This game has none and yet still you will die frequently, for other reasons. Overall it is just the right length and I didn't notice any bugs. The 2 biggest complaints I have about this game are the puzzles and the instant deaths. The puzzles, for the most part, are reasonable. Often there are clues around. But in at least 2 cases you have to properly arrange a series of dials and levers to get something to the correct numbers. This is pretty much a guessing game as there is no logical rationale around how it works. Unless you want to fiddle with fake dials for an hour the best option is to get the solution online. Even online most people just give you the answer without an explanation because, again, there is no logic to the answer. The satellite dish in particular followed this path as you have to get to a certain signal strength. Moving 2 different dials controls that but as you move one dial the numbers go up and down. Same for the other dial. Unless the first dial is in the spot it needs to be in you will never get enough strength. Yet any # of other locations on that same dial will give strength as well, just not enough. So you end up moving the first dial a little at a time and then the second dial through its range until you find the magic range they both need. No amount of logic helps here. These puzzles should have been rethought. The other issue is the instant deaths. There are a few QTEs in the game and while you are normally used to button mashing for them sometimes you actually have to focus on the QTE indicator first. This is never explained and is only done in 1 or 2 cases. Failure to figure this out and you will keep failing the QTE and dying. Some semblance of instructions would have been helpful here. In other cases you just suddenly die and have to go figure out why. Often there is no rationale. This game needs a few more hints or a plain old instruction on some of its less logical areas. Overall a pretty easy game. I got an Aliens vibe from it. With some better thought out puzzles this has the makings of a very good game.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/moons-of-madness

I had never played the first Simulator so I didn't know what to expect really. Spoiler Alert I wasn't let down at all. I was quite surprised just how hooked I was. This review is actually a little late because I just couldn't stop playing it. Don't get me wrong it is a Simulator so some of you may get bored, because hunting can be slow and boring at times just like fishing. When that fish hits the line or you see that Buck creeping around the corner things get real exciting real fast. That is one of the amazing things about it you just don't know when or If something is going to happen. :Hunting Simulator is the same way you can go thirty minutes on some levels and not see a thing. Especially in the really wooded areas. Animals hear you, so your creeping around in the woods or running you are going to scare them away. Just like in real life. Let's get back though to the start of the game though.You can either skip or go with the tutorial. I recommend doing it. It's really simple and short. You choose if you want to be a Man or Woman there isn't any customization though. You can how ever buy tons of licensed gear though to wear. You choose what animal license you want first. The first one is free, and you get a free weapon depending on which animal you choose as well. The rest of the license aren't that expensive either though. Think the top is like 350 to 500 but you start with 5,000. You need to shop smart though, because you might want another gun to hunt other things, and a bag to carry 2 weapons instead of one. You really have to think about it, because it can take awhile to make money. Especially if you want to trophy your first hunts instead of selling them. The trophies all appear around your lodge and it looks really cool. At the Lodge you can look at your trophies, test weapons at the range, listen to music, change your load outs, change your companion, shop, and choose where you wish to go. So it's like a major base of operations. There are 3 States and each State has two locations.The locations all vary as well. Some are Desert , flat grassy fields, wooded areas, and more. Each place has different animals, but some of the same as well. If you got a license for a state you can use it on both of it's locations. If you change States though you are required to get one for that state. There is also a limit to how many you can get with that license as well. So it makes sure you are learning to hunt the other animals as well. They all react different , and have different ways to approach. Like a Cougar, Elk, or Sheep might just walk around a easy hunt, but others not so much. Like ducks you have to shoot them over land to get them, A large animal like a Bear might require multiple shots. Everything keeps you learning and trying new things. The experience feels really realistic, and you can lose hours of your life just waiting for an Animal you want to come along. Time flies when you play, and it's very addicting. It's also a really calming experience as well. The areas are beautiful, very easy on the eyes. The sun peeping through trees or a stream and waterfall flowing nearby. It's just really pleasant to sit and relax and wait for the perfect trophy to come along.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/hunting-simulator-2

I love the design of these levels, I love the design of the mechs, just more needed to be done sortve like is done in this level being shown now, where the water will randomly electrocute you, bringing the map to life… more of this needs to be done, and really more party like game modes, have my doing more than simple mashing buttons, because this is a good party fighting game, but it could be a great one with a variety of more modes, even if its just dumb fun like the control battles…And cosmetic wise, this is a major disappointment as well, each individual body part can be customized with an option of 4 colors each mech, but the accessories are shared and it feels a bit lazy, as not all accessories work with all mechs, I cant put a monocle over sunglasses, this should’ve been thought out better, give each charcter its own unique accessories, really giving me a reason to grind for coins once every character is mine..Overall override as a series has potential, you wont necessarily regret picking it up if youre doing so to play with friends online, but with a major lack in content, I cant see it keeping your or your friends attention for long..I give Override 2: Super Mech Leaguea 7/10",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/override-2-super-mech-league

XCOM type game means it is a turn base strategy game, fighting against some monstruous creatures, featuring character and weapon development as well as strong irreversable choinces all rounded with fun goofy style graphics. Low-budget means that sound and graphics will be repetitive, some features are not polyshed (translation is awful, surely done with an automated free translator) and some mechanics are either totally overpowered (like armor and ranged & root weapons) or completelye underpowered. Also, you will find glitches and bugs, some minor like few app crashes not particularly disturbing because the automated save, others somehow annoying like the fact that they forgot to port a diary recording all miniquest so you don't forget them. However, the bright side is that Dread Nautical is actually a true game, not just some time-consuming app. There are certainly some novelties and nice mechanics and the developers really putted some great ideas in the game (like the character recruiting). The set up is alse really nice and the weapons, descriptions and character comments are very hylarious (it is great to nock out an enemy with a cd machine while your characters comment ""knock out, punk!"").

Tennis World Tour 2 is now the best tennis game of the generation; a large improvement over the embarrassment of its predecessor that still had many issues after its launch patch. The best tennis video games offer addictive gameplay, and solid control and brilliant graphics.At the genre’s best, there’s something about executing the shots that excites you and encourages you to play this time around. Tennis World Tour 2 doesn’t quite have that quality, but it’s not the worst gameplay experience your encounter either. I have many fond memories of my time with my arcade version of Sega's Virtua Tennis 2 so I am a bit of a tough critic on Tennis titles as a fan of the game and genre. The good section is a bit sparse, but there are some aspects of the game that pop because of good lighting. These bright spots are more prevalent for night matches. Those who have played AO Tennis 2 will find this system familiar. For the most part it is, although there is one crucial difference and it’s a change that almost ruins the experience for rookie players. This time around, there is no indicator to tell the player when to release the button and little consistency in regards to hitting a perfect shot. At the end of the day, I could go through all of the modes and talk about some of the other areas the game struggles but the core gameplay of Tennis World Tour 2 is just up to par with where it needs to be to be a solid Tennis title for your Xbox One. The mechanics and the animation feel a bit dated and somewhat bland but if your a seasoned player of the genre there is something here for you. If you aren't a traditional player of Tennis titles you may want to approach with a bit of caution from the changes made to the new version while improvements are apparent it can be a bit cumbersome for newer players in the end. As a fan I recommend it for your Xbox One library if you are a fan of the genre.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/tennis-world-tour-2

You are involved in an accident, whereby you are put into hibernation by the mothership, Ellie, the ships AI, wakes you up years later, and you have no idea where you are or what is going on. As you play, you will quickly learn that this is an on rails shooter, meaning that you go where the AI takes you, and with the exception of some quick time events, whereby you need to choose an option of what to do next, all directional activities are controlled for you.

The enemy design is laughable at best and pitiful at worst without a single moment of tension existing at any point during the experience. Most of the ""enemies"" just stand there doing nothing, looking like a free unity model with a low quality shader on them... because they are a free unity character model with a low quality shader on them.

Can't out run/out maneuver the monster C. Have a piss poor checkpoint system, and D. are stuck in a tiny ass room with it, searching random f*cking drawers for dumbass notes that are required to progress. The storyline is immediately apparent from the first 20 seconds and the voice actor sounds like the devs woke him up at 4am, kicked him in the chest, handed him a mic and yelled ""READ IT QUIETER DAMMIT!!"" every time he tried to show emotion. Seriously, my 80 year old grandparents could show more emotional range. The game also spells out its story themes like you're the slowest chimpanzee who's still working through pre-k for the 20th year in a row. It's a combination of copy and pasted ideas from better games and movies, without a single original idea in sight. Silent Hill, Observer, Layers of Fear, Amnesia, The Shining, Stranger Things, Repulsion (though I doubt the devs have even seen that movie with how embarrassing their ""homage"" was) nothing is safe from this game's shameless imitations. It also looks like pure sh*t, and these devs need a quick lesson in Unity's post processing because apparently it's too f*cking hard for these jugheads to figure out. You know the color grading is terrible when the fire somehow looks grey. Even the music is annoying and they probably would have been better suited to just let ol' Kevin Macleod do the honors.

And I spent 5 hours with pleasure in the storyline of this game. I really liked the game. It was like I took part in an FF movie. And it was amazing, I went through the company in one breath. This is an interesting experience, arcade, but quite comfortable and enjoyable gameplay.Now I'll go through the game in more detail:- The gameplay is arcade racing with obstacles and goals, everything is in the spirit of FF, you are a mega cool character, the rest are nothing. The cars have weapons, each has its own. In the course of the game there will be street races, and chases for villains, and chases from the police, and everything is mixed at once.- The graphics for the arcade racing game are good, all the detail priorities are correct. This is not a walker in the open world, where you can look at every leaf, this is a race at breakneck speeds where you have to fight and achieve the task on your iron horse.- Physics. Physics is all in the FF style and that says it all.- The world of the game. This is a tunnel race in an almost open world, but it is not particularly striking, since you are free to choose one of several paths to the goal. With the exception of some locations, in which, according to the plot, the action takes place along a long straight line. And besides, this is the world of FF, enjoy the crazy action.- Sound and music. For me, everything is just super, the compositions are great, the soundtrack is appropriate and blends well with the atmosphere of what is happening on the screen. The sound effects, of course, are not top notch if you listen, but in a hot pursuit you will not pay attention to it, everything is fine here too.- Bugs. Yes, they are, they are small and most I noticed only when replaying. Although, a couple of pieces caught my eye during the first playthrough, but they are absolutely harmless, especially in comparison with how big companies screw up, such as EA or Bethesda. In general, bugs do not interfere with playing absolutely. The game never crashed or freezed. I have nothing to say about the optimization, on my hardware the game ran at maximum settings without problems.- Management. There won't be any problems on consoles. The controls in the game are simple and pleasant. The only problem is, if you play on PC, it would be nice to have an Xbox gamepad. Because the keyboard and mouse controls are just disgusting by default. Perhaps I am blind and did not understand how to remap the keys in the settings, so I just took the gamepad from Xbox one.- Online. The idea is very interesting. Two teams (heroes and bandits) compete with each other, something like the king of the hill in cars, and the third (police) must neutralize them all to the last. Each team has three players. There is one minus here and very fat, online is almost dead, if not completely dead.Yes, the game has both disadvantages. But seriously, which game doesn't have them? To summarize, the game is good. I enjoyed spending a couple of evenings in it. I relaxed enjoying the simple and fun gameplay. I watched a simple but interesting and brutal story (hello to the FF franchise). I was furious, replaying some of the points in the game. I was very surprised by a couple of plot twists. And if you measure it by money, then for a couple of evenings relaxing in restaurants, cafes or somewhere else hanging out with family and friends, I will spend the same amount as the game costs.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/fast-furious-crossroads
