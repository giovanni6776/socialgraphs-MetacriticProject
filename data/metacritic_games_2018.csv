I'll break down my review into individual segments: Controls: 10/10Very tight, extremely simple controls. Move with Left control stick. Jump with B. Dash with Y. Climb walls with RT. End of tutorial. But the sheer amount of mileage these developers get out of such a simple base is staggering Gameplay: 10/10While the controls are deceptively simple, every single chapter introduces a few new mechanics that you will have to master in order to progress. Whether they be platforms that disintegrate underneath you, platforms that move in sync with your dashing, walls you can dash through that have a unique effect. gemstones that replenish your dash midair, bubbles that shoot you far off into certain directions, and the list goes on and on, each new mechanic requires you to use them with near perfect precision and timing. The challenge can be occasionally frustrating, and you may find yourself dying several hundred times in any given chapter (I'm not exaggerating, you will die a lot), but it's the good kind of frustration that invites you to persist, not the kind that will cause you to rage quit. And none of your deaths feel out of your control. It doesn't require you to memorize every obstacle coming next, because there's never anything popping up that you didn't expect. Every obstacle is laid out in front of you, clear for you to see, which makes the challenge more inviting than frustrating.But I don't want to scare off potential players who are not so keen on the sound of timing and precision based gameplay, since that doesn't sound particularly fun by description alone, but this is a joy to play and an innumerable amount of sequences had me smiling and feeling accomplished by their end. Difficulty Level: 7/10I know 7 seems fairly low considering how much time I've already spent re-emphasizing the demand for precision, and how often you're going to die, and I'm sure you've already seen many other reviews that describe it to be tough as nails, and it is, but (thankfully) the game doesn't punish you for dying over and over and over and over. I had more than 300 deaths in a single chapter once. But this game doesn't kick you in the balls the way Cuphead does every time you die, you always re-spawn in the same frame that you died in, and it takes roughly half a second to re-spawn. The sheer amount of precision the game demands in and of itself would be enough to make it a 10, but the forgiving nature of the game makes the challenge much more manageable, so you can throw yourself at the same obstacle over and over and over and over again until you get it right, which is a godsend, because I would have honestly never bothered finishing the game if I had to deal with a lives system, or if it sent me back to the beginning of each level, or something like that. Story: 7/10I'm actually not as enamored with the story as many other people seem to be. I think it's great to see more and more video games experiment in dealing with heavy thematic matter such as anxiety, panic, apathy, depression, emotional distance, etc, and I think Celeste does a good job of it, and I can imagine many people out there being touched by it, because it handles delicate topics with sensitivity, earnestness, and a touch of humor. I like the characters a lot (and I love that they actually created an Instagram account for the character who is always taking selfies and writing posts throughout the game), but I don't think it's quite perfect yet. I really hope the developers keep experimenting with this kind of subject matter, because Celeste has made me eager for whatever the dish up next. Artwork/Design: 8/10I used to refer to this segment as ""graphics,"" because graphical power used to be important when reviewing games, but we've reached an era of gaming when gamers and reviewers are less concerned about graphical horsepower and more interested in artwork, with absolutely beautiful looking games such as Cuphead and Journey, which are both stunning games due to their artwork, even though they're not going to max out the system you run them on by any means. Celeste is in that category, and it is a brilliantly designed game. Music: 9/10It is impressive in and of itself that these indie developers composed more than two hours of music for a relatively short game (around 10hrs max to complete all of the main bits, 20 if you're a completionist that is going to collect all the strawberries and complete all the ""B side"" challenges), and it pays off, because the soundtrack is just beautiful. Overall: 10/10While I think the story is good, even though I wasn't as deeply impressed with it as many other reviewers were, the controls, gameplay, and design are every bit as good as you've heard and Celeste is a game that deserves to be experienced by anybody who can spare twenty bucks to try it out.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/celeste

I've only unlocked a small fraction of the game (there is a whole bunch of different mechs and pilots to unlock - I guess that other reviewer ""Rrichard"" missed the menu where you can do that...) and playing Hard for the first time, I already had a moment where the grid was down to 1 point (at 0, it's Game Over...) and am not at all sure that I will be able to finish it. But even if I will be - it certainly was challenging and I can't wait to try out other mechs and complete all sorts of achievements (which are needed to unlock more stuff ingame). There's also a fairly large amount of variety in the missions you're presented with. Sure, after the 5th playthrough or so, you will probably have tried them all but... that's nothing to sneeze at in my opinion. And the more you play it on Hard, the more you realize how incredibly fine-tuned the AI is. I'm not sure whether they always attack in the ideal manner because often times when I thought about my next move for like 5 minutes and at first not seeing how I can pull it off without failing an objective or sacrificing grid power, I thought of a sequence of moves that would resolve those issues. It seems like probably no other combination would have resolved this better and makes me wonder whether NPCs intentionally attack in a way that there is usually a solution that requires very little sacrifice (if any at all).

It begins with an exorcism on Player One, and once that’s done, the successful exorcists explain that you have been possessed for a year and that the demon wearing your flesh has been cutting a bloody swath across New York. Worse, the slaughter served some unknown agenda. Luckily your erstwhile rescuers are professional hunters of the supernatural, and they’ll have your back across six missions plus the finale. And it’s up to you to follow your own trail of corpses and clean up the mess. Thus begins The Unavowed. I was immediately hooked, and that engagement didn’t let up until the credits rolled, and it only slightly tempered off until they rolled a second time. The Unavowed is a great plot told in an adventure game fascinating between competent and excellent. With regards to gameplay, there is little to be said. The Unavowed is an unapologetic adventure game, with long conversations and a lot of inventory puzzles. A twist is proved by your companions: Every chapter you can pick two out of four companion characters to go with you. They provide background chatter, but into your conversations and serve as inventory items to rub against parts of the game world to unlock progress. As fantastical as the plot gets, the puzzles and riddles are all based on sound logic. They make you feel clever without you necessarily having to be clever. Also, whenever you get stumped, which usually happened to me when I solved a puzzle and wasn’t quite sure where to go next, you can ask your companions, and that would usually help me along just fine. With regards to the plot and the script, they are what helps The Unavowed become an excellent game. The story is cleverly structured into chapters, each about a game session long and providing a satisfying arc and an antagonist to defeat, and each chapter tightly connected to the central mystery of what your demonic squatter is actually up to. Add to that a Sixth Sense level twist at the eleventh hour and a very satisfying conclusion, and the judgement can only be: Dave Gilbert’s script is excellent. The dialogue is also excellent, not only because of the word, but because of the cast. Logan Cunningham brings his unbelievably sexy timbre to bear, but everybody really brings their A game. The score is just as great: Excellent mood pieces, effective stingers… What more can you ask for? The visual side of things is where your mileage may vary. The Unavowed is an Indie game, and here is where it shows: The lovingly crafted pixel art that unfortunately looks worse and worse the bigger your monitor is. I hear some people are fans of this art style, but my proclivities go more in the direction of Control, so I merely tolerate it. It may still mark it as excellent among its peers that the game nevertheless got me to care for the mass of pixels I was piloting. Still, even I was wowed by some of the Hopper-esque backgrounds. All of this adds up to a great time at the Keyboard. Highly recommended. TLDR: If you like the classic or even Telltale school of adventure games, do not sleep on this. If you are a fan of Urban Fantasy, don’t sleep on this. There is little here for the Follower of the Twitch Reflex, but everybody else should not miss out on this excellent yarn.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/unavowed

Now while i have only finished 7 visual novels with some on my backlog , however it doesn't change that fact that i really, really liked this game. The story/ plot was interesting all the way trough with alot of twist and turns i didn't see coming. While i have played alot of sad and emotinal  games during my time, this has to be one of the saddest or most emotional once, has at least a couple of scenes that really hit you or at least it hit me. I really liked the setting , that it takes place in modern Japan or a Japan from 2008 or so, despite it being 10 years old i think it has hold up pretty well. I really like all the varied characters you met or/ and you played as. They were more then varied enough, and how the all got intertwined with each other from time to time was really , really great. I liked the fact that you play as 5 different characters all with they own personality and the own reason to be a part of the story. I liked that you can jump back and forth between characters to unlock more parts of the story. I loved all the weird and funny bad endings , i think most if not all of those i have seen makes sense, but some are still pretty funny or weird. I really liked that the game had some humor, and had it share of funny moments. Also think the soundtrack is pretty damn good. Their might be some wrong typos, but not that many and it didn't affect the game for me, but well thats about the only negative thing i got. If you can play this game without to much hype, and you play a hr or two a day or so, you will get yourself a fantastic game that i argue deserves far more attention and that goes for the genre it self to, this is quickly becoming one of my all time favourite games if it isn't even that already. Excellent game with alot of humor and charm and if you just can accept that it takes place in 2008 or so ,you will get an excellent Visual novel. Recommended if you like that genre. PS: i am not to fond of the rating system, but i would consider this a masterpiece even tough that word is used to much especially if you can play it slow or just take you time to enjoy it and try to ignore the hype.

And sure you can get cards in real life instead but keep in mind there are no craft in real life so getting those deck in real life will be expansive plus not everyone has many friends to play with either. I saw some of the negative reviews and those are what I think about them. Also let me say I would like this game even more if it didn't had micro toward cards, but I still put it high up cause crafting won't make your hard work feel like a waste for pay to win players cause crafting is easy to begin with, and it's still better than buying new sequels everytime that's not free. And maybe I'm just lucky but I didn't found much bugs either. I do have a bit of a control problem whenever it asks me to discard a card but that's for Mobile, PC version is ok. That being said those negative reviews are old so maybe it was correct for some of them like the bugs at one point in the past but it certainly isn't like that for me now though.

However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer. Danmaku Unlimited 3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that makes the genre so exciting to play. Okay, so how does the game do that?CORE A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft, the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire. GRAZING Get the core close to bullets to just barely ""graze"" it will power up the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that makes you feel like a total boss. SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the player can safely touch while also powering up the plane. All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet free turkey shoot.I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't I just breeze though the game then?The game has two unique modes, GRAZE MODE features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the toughest traditional bullet hell titles.Is there a story?It is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers. Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!Music is by BLANKFIELD from Japan, who does awesome remixes of Touhou and many other anime/game musics!Anything else? - The campaign features 5 stages each ending with an epic multi-stage boss fight.- Up to 25 weapon combinations for players to unlock and experiment to find what works best for them.- Unique rendering technique that procedurally animate sprites on the fly.- TATE support for players that use vertical screens.

Don't let the 'pinball' part scare you if you don't like pinball games... honestly, the pinball aspect is very low key.

Thankfully the game was worth the wait and in my opinion it’s one of the best 2D adventures I’ve ever played which is no small feat because there have been many 2D adventures I’ve enjoyed over the years. If you love games with charming stories then Owlboy does more than enough to satisfy that urge. The story is both fun and interesting throughout and in the end you get really attached to the characters that are present in the story. The characters on the whole are wonderful and you can tell that a lot of thought and effort has gone into them because each character feels important and plays an important part throughout your time with the game. The gameplay that accompanies the fantastic story and characters has been done to perfection. Everything about the gameplay feels tight and responsive and each different mechanic has been done that well that it adds something different to the gameplay. I was also very impressed with the level design in the game and the amount of variety that’s present in each level makes exploring a very fun and enjoyable experience. There is also a number of different puzzles for you to get to grips with in the different levels and thankfully the clever design of these puzzles meant that I hardly ever got frustrated, which is a bonus. I must admit that I was surprised by how much content the game has and it will keep you satisfied for a number of hours and the best thing is that you never seem to get bored throughout your time with the game. Unfortunately though once you complete the game you’re highly unlikely to return back to it and that’s a shame because the content that’s on offer is absolutely amazing. The presentation that accompanies the fantastic content is also amazing and I loved everything about this aspect of the game. Visually the game can look really beautiful at times and when you combine that with the very charming sound design it ends up bringing the gameplay and story alive at every turn. At the end of the day Owlboy is one of them rare games where I don’t really have a gripe with anything that they offer up and I must admit that Owlboy is one of the most enjoyable game’s I’ve played so far this year. In fact as far as the 2D adventure genre goes it may very well be my most favourite game I’ve ever played in the genre and to say that’s an impressive feat would be a massive understatement to say the least. Without a doubt Owlboy gets a massive recommendation from me and if you’re a fan of this specific genre then the game is an absolute must buy.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/owlboy

Often there is no right or wrong because every character has a different story and, like in real life, their own truth in it. Banner Saga achieves to convey the message in a beautifully designed world and the matching soundtrack strikes in the heart to make you feel as a part of the journey that it takes you with. I love the game because I can grasp a bit of it for real life. Some decisions, not all, makes you think about ideas you normally wouldn't think about because you haven't been in a situation that required it. I'll keep Banner Saga in memory because it is a piece of art entirely and a figurehead as to what a video game can be instead of being dull and meaningless.

As you can imagine I was thrilled to learn it was coming to the Xbox One and thankfully it’s a game I can see me playing for a very long time. Without a doubt this game is super addictive and the amount of replayability on this game is almost endless, and the best thing is that it never seems to get boring. The reason it doesn’t get boring is because every match you play is completely different and it keeps on surprising you, which is great. Everybody can enjoy this game because they’ve made the gameplay very simple to understand and the featured easy to pick up and play style doesn’t have any flaws. This is mainly down to the fantastic controls that have been implemented. Everything about the controls remained tight and responsive throughout and they keep everything simple yet very effective. You may have noticed that I’ve used the word simple quite a few times, but don’t worry because the game will definitely provide you with a challenge as well. I suspect you would expect the challenging moments to be frustrating then, but that couldn’t be more wrong because not once did I become frustrated and instead it just remained fun and enjoyable at all times. It’s especially fun when played with friends and the game definitely rewards you working together as a team. The teamwork in the game is absolutely brilliant and to top it off there are a number of different moves and classes for you to try out. I was especially impressed with the classes in the game because each one has a lot of variety and this keeps things fresh throughout. In terms of gripes I don’t really have too many. I would’ve liked a few more maps and I would’ve liked the maps to have a little more variety, but I was easily able to look past this due to the fantastic gameplay. I would’ve also liked a little more variety when it came to the presentation side of the game as well, but they don’t do anything seriously wrong here. The visuals and sound design are not bad it’s just that they can become a little boring after a while. At the end of the day Laser League is an absolutely brilliant game and I’m very excited to see how the game evolves over the coming months. I haven’t been this excited about a game of this ilk since Rocket League and with more content and a little bit more work I can see this being as big as Rocket League.

Moonlighter definitely is one of those games. The idea behind this game is as simple as it is incredibly fun: At night, you crawl dungeons in a rogue-lite fashion, and at day... you sell the goods you looted the night before! The game perfectly blends rogue-lite elements (although perma-death is replaced by losing almost all items you found and a bunch of gold) with elements of a decent economic sim. The dungeon crawling part is as you'd expect it. You can carry two weapons that you can switch on the fly, with every weapon having a primary and secondary attack. You can dodge-roll and take potions (if you have any) to avoid damage and restore health. Although your goal of the dungeon crawling part is to reach to boss of the dungeon, there is a twist: For some gold, you can use your ""amulet"" which will teleport you back to town and end the run, so you can secure the loot you already have. The economic sim part is you being in your shop, selling the loot you grabbed. Cool idea: as you progress in the game, you will unlock other vendors to upgrade your weapons and armor, to buy potions and enchantments etc. From that moment on you need to evaluate: What stuff do you want to sell, and what do you want to keep to upgrade your equipment? If you sell stuff, you actually have to find the right price (customers will show you via emotes if your price is perfect, too high, too low etc) and have an eye on demand (don't sell the same stuff over and over again). What else? Graphics are an absolutely beautiful example of pixel art, very detailed with amazing animations. Music is a little bland, but still catchy and never really annoying or dull. All in all: One of the best Indie games in recent months. For the price of only 20 bucks, clear recommendation to buy!",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/moonlighter

I got the same emotional rollercoaster which I loved in the first. I just missed Max from the other game. You get emotionally attached to all the characters. Max was just so relatable to myself so she was my favorite. You will relate to one character at least because their attitudes are very realistic. This series is a beautiful experience. Every gamer should atleast try both but this game definitely gets a bit lifted up if you play the previous original first. Still great tho. And if you get the deluxe you will get an episode with Max!

The Adventure Pals is a game that people of all ages can enjoy and whilst it suffers with a few shortcomings me and my children still had a lot of fun with it, which is obviously what you want from a game. There are a few levels for you to get to grips with and I must admit that I was very impressed with the level design because each level is packed with a great deal of variety. I would however have liked a bit more content because there isn’t a vast amount for you to get to grips with, but thankfully the content that is here is very enjoyable. There are a few different elements in play at the same time and most of them hold up really well. The combat is something that I especially enjoyed and the simplicity of it means that you never get frustrated which is great considering if you die you have to start from the beginning of the level again. Thankfully I didn’t die that often but when I did die it was a bit of a nuisance returning back to the start of the level again. I will say though that dying is completely your fault and not the game’s fault because the game doesn’t suffer with any technichal issues and the controls that have been implemented remain tight and responsive throughout, which is great. I would however have liked the platforming side of the game to have had a bit more work put into it because jumping and traversing can feel a little floaty and awkward which can be a bit off-putting at times. If you like silly stories then The Adventure Pals will definitely put a smile on your face. It without a doubt made me and my children laugh out loud a few times and this made us to be able to connect with the characters quite a lot. The presentation side of the game also made us connect with the characters as well and that was mainly down to how much charm the visuals and sound design had and without a doubt the colourful visuals and nice sound design add to your overall experience and in some ways they make the gameplay even more fun. At the end of the day The Adventure Pals is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and they definitely got more right than they got wrong. It may not be the best game of its type I’ve played but it does what it sets out to do and that is create a fun and enjoyable experience for the whole family and for that reason it gets a thumbs up from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-adventure-pals

Before i go any further with how much I love this game I will say do not jump into the series with the third game. You will be lost, and annoyed with immediately. The game story is the end of end times. You play (or make decisions as) a couple of characters, but mostly Rook/Alette who are the leaders of the caravan trying to protect the last city for humanity. Their storyline is very Game of Thrones with political discord, betrayals and characters dying like they're on the set of The Walking Dead. The other story is focused on those trying to stop this calamity you mainly play as a Varl (giant with horns) named Iver. This story is more about survival, and how far are you willing to push your crew to make it to the end in time to save everyone. The game is text heavy...like the story is all text so if you hate that stay the hell away from it. For those who have played the first two games maybe replay them before you jump in this one because it can get a bit confusing on what is going on at first. I am unfortunately split on how I liked the ending. They have multiple endings which is good. I made bad decisions and believe I got the bad ending. I only say that because there was no closure for most of my characters. The game sorta just ended for me. This left me with a ""that's it?"" feeling. I do adore the story up until my ending, but that was mine others might have a kick-ass heroic ending. The gameplay is a great turned based strategy that is in a lot of ways like a game of chess. I love it even if I might not be very good at it. The multiple races make the game feel unique on how you build your team. You will want a balance of Horseborn (centaurs), Varl, and humans because they all bring different abilities to the fights. The leveling up is the same with using renown to level up, and buy resources. The level cap on characters is smaller than you'd imagine, but that is because there are over 40 characters! Overall the game is rounding off a great trilogy if you're a fan of the series then you probably already bought it. If you read my review, and never touched the games before seriously do not start with this one you will be lost and upset. The story is fantastic even though I got a terrible ending, but I blame myself. I give this a high, high BUY.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-banner-saga-3

Zoink Games have delivered quite a few memorable experiences and as far as developers go they’re definitely one of my favourites. As you can imagine then I was very excited to get to grips with Flipping Death and thankfully it didn’t disappoint. In fact Flipping Death could be the best game that Zoink Games has done so far, which is no small feat considering the amount of successes they have under their belt.

It was not a complete disaster, but it was far from anything spectacular. Having spent a good deal of time with the sequel, Bleed 2, I feel like the complaints I had on the original were taken to heart and the follow-up was made specifically for me. The story picks up after the ending of the original, with an alien terror attacking the unnamed city that our heroine Wryn resides in. Quickly running head first into battle, she’s faced with 7 new levels of platforming and shooting shenanigans. Each level features a style reminiscent of the Super Nintendo era filled with bright colors and much more inspired enemies. While there’s not a huge selection of standard baddies to battle, there are a number of new boss battles which make up the meat of the game, as each level features a few bosses to tackle. This mode is much more accessible than the previous entry due to unlimited lives being offered and a very forgiving checkpoint system, with some boss battles featuring mid battle checkpoints. That being said, the normal difficulty here is more akin to the easy mode on the original. With a total of 4 difficulties, each with their own associated unlocks and leader boards, there is a decent amount of replay value here despite the short campaign which can be completed in under an hour. If you’re looking for more of a challenge there is an Arcade mode, which only offers one life; a 3 vs 1 boss battle option; and a rogue-lite mode that features randomized levels/enemies, each with a boss to finish them out. While some games shoe horn this mode in, with Bleed 2 it works beautifully, although it is a bit more difficult than the main game. These randomized levels look and feel like you are playing a Mega Man mod and feature traps that are nowhere to be found in the main game. This is by no means a bad thing, though it will take some serious practice to make any type of progress as there are no continues. Add in the ability to use different weapons or additional characters you unlock and the replay options are endless. The new characters and weapons that you’ll unlock change up the game in some pretty fun ways. Some characters are limited to their stock attack and feature new abilities, and there are new weapons that The Rival or Wryn can use. Each variation will require you to play a little differently, with each character or weapon excelling at specific situations and will make others a bit more difficult. I personally had a great deal of fun speed running through the game with the rocket launcher, which essentially makes most of the bosses powerless, even beating a few ignoring their battle specific mechanics entirely. Bleed 2 controls much better than the original, as I was able to easily get into the habit of jumping multiple times and was soon using the slow motion ability like a pro. I did struggle a bit at first, as the pop up tutorials are not always as in depth as I would prefer.  My biggest issue is the requirement to go into the menu and manually change your character’s weapons, as there is no easy option to do so during gameplay. While this is not overly cumbersome, it does ruin the sense of momentum that shines throughout the rest of the title. Couch co-op is much more enjoyable than in the original game, partially due to the game being less reliant on the platforming aspect and focusing more on shooting, making it much easier to keep track of the second player. I did get mildly frustrated playing as one of the bosses, as it can be hard to determine which of the characters is the player and which is the boss. While these instances are few and far between, it does make the experience slightly less enjoyable. With Bleed 2 fixing a number of the annoying aspects from the original, I wholeheartedly recommend this title for anyone who is looking for a new bullet-hell type shooter with loads of replayability.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/bleed-2

One moment that was particularly awe-inspiring was when I warp-jumped dangerously close to a star, my whole view dominated by it's undulating, apocalyptic surface; unfortunately I had no time to admire the view as my ships systems started to progressively malfunction from the heat. The developers have really captured the danger inherent to space exploration with numerous kinds of natural hazards that can really change the dynamic of an environment. Some of them I only encountered once in 40+ hours of play, like the aforementioned warp-jump into a star. The narrative is very flimsy, essentially just a contrivance to frame the gameplay. Fortunately the gameplay itself is fantastic, with a huge amount of content to explore and secrets to uncover. There are 24 primary weapons, but there are a huge range of modifications that can be used to tailor them to suit your play style. Coupled with 4 different ships, myriad secondary weapons, devices (both active and passive) and consumables you really can play the game however you want. From a sneaky cloaked scout that snipes enemies from afar, to a turreted heavily armoured gunship that charges into the midst of enemy formations, there is as much variety in ship specification and loadout as you would expect from a deep RPG. Initially the controls felt a bit awkward, but after a few hours of play I genuinely feel that these are the best 3-axis spaceship controls I have ever experienced. It feels so natural zipping around asteroids and boosting into a roll to avoid a missile. Movement is key to surviving your encounters, especially with larger ships, so it's important that the controls feel intuitive. Like all rougelikes there is a degree of repetition, I would say the game is at it's best when you only play it for a few hours a day, although it can absolutely be addicting if a run is going well. The learning curve isn't especially steep if you play cautiously, but half of the fun is taking risks in order to potentially find that elite enhanced weapon or ancient glyph. There is almost always a temptation to push your luck just that little bit further, sometimes with disastrous results; anyone who enjoys rouguelikes will know that this is an essential aspect of the genre. It took me 40+ hours to complete the game and get the 'true' ending, I took my time and explored thoroughly, experimenting with different play styles and loadouts. Ironically after 35 hours of play and after settling into what I expected to be my end-game ship configuration, loot preference etc I stumbled on to whole new way to play the game. Not only did this end up being more fun than anything I had experienced before, but it also completely changed the way i approached every obstacle!

You may recruit dogs, cats or other animals to assist you in your deadly trip. Most of the time you will NOT succeed and you will die.

You have to be 100% committed because you know you have just one shot. If you fail, it's too bad, try again! But don't worry because dying in this game may be a little bit frustrating but not that much. It's all about the journey.

This definitely payed off in this case.  First, the story. This is the first Behemoth game that confirms that most, if not all the Behemoth games are connected, which I find very interesting.  The story is very complex, and will pull you in for hours and hours.  The characters are very charming, the bear is funny (also voiced by the narrator from BattleBlock Theater), and it's nothing but a thrill ride all the way through.  Next, the game-play. What can I say except it's good old turn based combat.  You might think the game-play would get old after an hour or two, but you would be dead wrong.  There are hundreds of characters that can equip different weapons and level up, and there are also different classes such as healers, shield's, swords, maces, and even range.  Next, I would like to talk about the final boss, since it's build up throughout the game.  Was it worth it? The final boss is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite final boss of all time.  The music, stage, enemy's, and objectives work perfectly here.  And not only that, it's very, very difficult.  By the time you finish the first phase, more then half of your time will be gone, and that is not a joke.  The fight is chaotic, and once you're done, it is quite satisfying.  Next, the music. Wash my hands, and buckle them pants.  What can I say?  It's a mix of jazz and thunder from Behemoth, and once again, they deliver a soundtrack that doesn't have a single mediocre song in it.Finally, and most importantly, the visuals. Holy sweet mother of potato salad, the visuals are bright, colorful, open, and inspiring.  The artwork gives off that classic game vibe we've been missing for a long time now, and when it shows, it shows. This is easily one of my favorite Behemoth games, and I cannot wait for more games to come out in the future.  This game, for me at least, is perfect.  I didn't have a single problem with it, and just like Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater, it is easily one of my favorite games of all time.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/pit-people

Each class will offer some weapons or abilities specific to the starting loadout, while replacements from other classes can be interchanged mid game in the event the weapon is found as a drop or from one of the chests. With this being said, experimentation is key for finding the best class for your playstyle, and the option to max out each skill tree gives the title a lot of replay value. The downfall to this mechanic is that at the start of each new run you will forfeit any gold that is not applied to your upgrades. Sadly, in a number of runs I would be just a few gold pieces short of my goal and ended up losing the progress from the previous run or throwing the upgrades into something that wasn’t really needed. With most options featuring 5 to 25 levels of rewards, this will be a grind for those in it for the long haul. As you begin your journey, you will find the game is a bit difficult; while the enemies do not require a lot of damage to be taken down, neither do you. As mentioned previously, choosing the right upgrades is paramount for making your future runs more successful. Choosing the right class will also be important, as each has their own pros and cons and does truly feel like you are playing as a different type of character, which is rare for most of the rouge-lite titles I have played in the past. Having unlocked all of the base versions of the gods in my time with the game, I found the high damage options to be much more entertaining, especially when being overwhelmed. If stealth or a medic option is your cup of tea, you’ll find those options early into the game, but their cons seemed to outweigh their pros for me. Each run is filled with randomly generated rooms as well as enemies that will drop rewards that alter gameplay, sometimes in your favor, other times not so much. As you progress through each room, you’ll be searching for secret areas holding chests which feature new weapons and scrolls. Some of these chests will be locked in a challenge room that will task you with reaching the chest under certain parameters, such as within a time limit or without taking damage. The one downfall here is that the rooms can become a bit repetitive after initial runs, making finding the secrets less of a challenge and more of a chore. There are a number of boss battles that you may encounter, as they appear to be randomly placed. While these did not feel unfair or overly challenging, I often didn’t make much progress encountering them with only a few bullets handy or a sliver of my health bar left. There is a fair bit of platforming involved in this game, as the rooms often feature a number of vertical levels, often hiding secret areas or chests. The controls make this very manageable, as movement is often loose and forgiving, allowing huge jumps to be accomplished with ease. It’s important to stay mobile to evade the number of enemies that are thrown at you at any given time as well. The biggest issue with the level design is that the map is initially really hard to read and after a short time, depending on the run you are given, everything starts to look the same. In addition to this, some of the upgrades or scrolls mentioned previously will unlock the entire map, which would normally be a good thing. In this, I found myself struggling to find the exit when I was graced with this upgrade. While it was nice to see where chests and alternate paths were prior to setting my course, it was difficult to determine where I had already visited, as well as where I needed to go. The game’s visuals are not breathtaking, but they aren’t meant to be. I don’t think this title would have gained much by taking on a darker tone, and personally found the brightly colored enemies a fun break from mowing down the Nazi’s, aliens, or zombies found in other shooters. Initially, I thought this was an attempt at being a more kid friendly venture; however, after hearing some of the redneck’s R-rated one-liners, I quickly learned that wasn’t the",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/immortal-redneck

Thankfully it lived up to its potential and as far as strategy RPG’s are concerned Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs is a very good addition to the genre. Something that really stood out for me in this game was its story. The story is charming and packed full of humour and the best thing is that it keeps you invested throughout your time with the game. This is a very good thing because there is a huge amount of content for you to get to grips with and the story makes the content even better which is impressive because the content that’s in the game is already very good. The main reason why the content is so good is because they’ve done a wonderful job of making each task you can undertake matter and the amount of variety each task has makes it both fun and enjoyable which ultimately means the game has a lot of replayability. You will however have to get used to some of the time limit tasks because they can be a little frustrating at times and a little bit more freedom would’ve been nice here, but this is only a small problem and you will get used to these tasks relatively quick. You can’t mention the tasks in the game without mentioning a very important aspect of a strategy RPG and that is the combat. The combat that’s in the game is awesome and everything about it feels solid and responsive throughout. It also rewards you greatly when in battle and this means if you die you don’t get too frustrated and you want to carry on immediately. You will however have to get used to the fiddly camera when in battle and the awkwardness of it can be a little annoying at times, but thankfully as you progress you tend to forget about this slight annoyance. One of my most favourite things about this game was without a doubt the presentation. Visually the game has a beautiful art style that captures your imagination and when you combine that with the excellent sound design and voice acting you end up having a very enjoyable and immersive experience. At the end of the day Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs takes all the good things an RPG offers you and delivers them to you in an almost flawless manner and this means if you’re a fan of these types of games then Regalia is an absolute must buy. I never once got bored with this game because it was fun from start to finish and in the end it’s a game that gets a very big recommendation from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/regalia-of-men-and-monarchs---royal-edition

It is played in real-time with slow motion or pause and has a surprising tactical depth. Your skills and equipment are equally important here to how you play your champions - where you position them and how you move them around. I started on normal difficulty and it was fine so I decided to change to hard - which was brutal. There is one other setting in the game called Epic - but it was too difficult for me. Having said that, this game is not for everyone - it is smart and requires some thinking about your choices and party builds.

In terms of content the game has more than enough to keep you occupied. There is also an abundance of unlockables for you to collect and collecting all of these gives the game quite a lot of replay value. An important thing in a game like this is the maps that are included, and thankfully they get this spot on. There are an array of maps for you to battle on and each map has a lot of variety going for it, so it was a pleasure trying each map out. The game doesn’t really suffer with many problems and my only real complaint is that the small technical issues can take away from the game’s charm, but thankfully these issues don’t happen very often. The presentation side of the game is absolutely perfect in my opinion. Visually the game has an art style that’s packed full of charm and they really do make the gameplay stand out. The sound design is also fantastic and the immersion levels due to the sound design can be off the charts at times. At the end of the day Wulverblade has brought back a lot of fond memories for me and it made me realise just how much I love this genre.

La idea es buena, pero al final da más la sensación de ""prueba todo con todo"" que realmente ser labor de detectives, y la experiencia acaba perdiendo fuelle. La historia tiene algunas cosas interesantes, pero la mayor parte del tiempo se pierde sin pena ni gloria en conversaciones que sobran (como todas las de los taxis) o en puntos de la conversacion que deberían llevar a sitios pero no llevan. El apartado gráfico inicialmente resulta interesante y llamativo, pero después rápidamente se vuelve cansino y fatigoso. Las imagenes son demasiado estáticas y el contraste tan marcado oculta una importante falta de detalles en los acabados.

It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you wont be able to see them. You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethans home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters. Still, the discoveries wont happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Pauls supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy. Key Features: *    Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley, which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments.*    Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethans disappearance -- and the fate of his family.*    Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction, all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft.*    Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace. Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter

Mothergunship allows you to do that and then some, but much to my surprise this isn’t the only thing it allows you to do and instead it offers up a number of different and intricate things for you to do along the way. In fact in terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to be getting on with and when the multiplayer option gets implemented I can see this being a game that’s very difficult to put down. Replaybility isn’t a problem even now thanks to its procedural design so imagine the replaybility when the multiplayer aspect comes to the game.  The gameplay then features a number of different mechanics for you to get to grips with and I’m pleased to say that each different mechanic is pretty much spot on. You’ll also notice right from the get go how much variety the gameplay has and that’s especially the case when it comes to the missions in the game. Each mission is fresh and interesting throughout and the enemies you face on these missions all have a creative side to them so completing a mission always feels satisfying. Starting a new mission however will get on your nerves a little bit and that’s mainly down to the loading times. The loading times literally feel like they go on forever and to say I got slightly annoyed with waiting around would be a little bit of an understatement. Thankfully though these are the only frustrating moments I experienced during my time with the game and I’m pleased to say that everything is perfect on the technichal side of things. I’m also pleased to say that the gameplay has got the perfect balance of being fair and challenging at the same time and if you’re worried about jumping in the game straight away then there’s a more than adequate tutorial to help you along the way. The story will also ease you into proceedings as well and whilst it failed to keep me invested throughout it still has a few decent parts placed into it. The presentation side of the game was actually one of my favourite things about the game and I felt that was mainly down to the atmosphere and immersiveness both the visuals and sound design created. At the end of the day as far as shooters go Mothergunship is a very decent shooter to say the least. All of the most important aspects are spot on and because of this any shortcomings the game has are quickly forgotten and in the end Mothergunship gets a big thumbs up from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/mothergunship

I mean, it already works on a tablet - problem is, the Switch is more than a mere tablet and this game fails to take that into account. For instance, playing in Docked mode is a huge burden, for the game does not take into account two things: first, the fact the Joy-Con can be adapted to work like a mouse and make moving much faster (you are forced to navigate with the analog pads); second, the game could make use of a higher resolution when in Docked mode (and, just like the PC version, adapt the screen to show more things). This makes Portable mode the only enjoyable way to play this game... which kind of contradicts with the idea of the Switch.

I was very impressed and in some ways surprised with the amount of replaybility the game had. The presentation side of the game ticks all of the right boxes because both the visuals and sound design create a very immersive experience. I really enjoyed being able to choose what dialogue options I wanted because it gave me a great sense of freedom and it made me become more attached to the game. In terms of the gameplay side of things there isn’t too much you can do which may be off-putting for some. If you don’t like these types of game’s then there isn’t anything new present here that will change your mind. The FMV genre seems to split opinions right down the middle and it’s either a genre you love or hate with a passion. I’m a fan of the genre and it’s nice to see that there has been a nice steady amount of game’s released in recent years. Some of them have been good and some of them have lacked in several areas but thankfully the new release called The Shapeshifting Detective is definitely one of the good ones. In fact it may very well be the best FMV I’ve played so far because it features an unforgettable story packed with character’s that are not only interesting but packed with depth as well. When it comes to the gameplay there isn’t a great deal available to you and if you’re not a fan of these types of game’s then there isn’t anything here that will change your mind. This is a shame because if you’re sitting on the fence with this genre then I urge you to make this game your first in this genre because you can tailor how you want the dialogue to go and this does give the game quite a bit of replaybility. At the end of the day then The Shapeshifting Detective is a masterpiece in parts and if you love a good story that hooks you throughout then you owe yourself to get this game.,https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-shapeshifting-detective

It is a pioneer in its style of gameplay, with very few similar titles appearing ever since the release of Mode7's first entry in the series. Individual matches present very unique challenges which fully engage player attention and require lots of complex decision making. These matches are strengthened by their variety, as the game is designed in such a way as for the randomly generated scenarios to have a considerable impact on the sort of problem solving necessary for the scene. The way the strategies of the game are learned is also extremely individualized, allowing personal value systems in general strategic philosophy to be just as valid as others, such that many unique and creative approaches can be taken to the game.The game launched with a very strong multiplayer community, and the very robust asynchronous multiplayer system was my personal main attraction to the game. Frozen Synapse 2 can be played on very unconventional schedules due to this element, making it a perfect opportunity to have in depth and meaningful multiplayer experiences when time otherwise might not permit. Furthermore, the multiplayer queuing system and available gameplay modes provide a very solid entry mechanism to multiplayer matches, requiring little effort on the part of the user. In strict comparison to its predecessor, Frozen Synapse 2 has a considerably improved quality of life in terms of a streamlined UI and more meaningful controls. Additionally, greater unit variety and enhanced terrain generation allow for vastly more challenges in strategic thinking, as opposed to the original where matches tended to be more consistent and similar to each other. As Frozen Synapse often times comes down to very precise moments, a few basic mechanics such as the targeting diamond, move-while-fire, and simultaneous kills reduce a lot of the strain of trying to perfect minutia on a tiny scale. Overall, Frozen Synapse 2 is an incredibly fun experience which delivers a unique style of gameplay which is very successful at creating an engaging strategic experience.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/frozen-synapse-2

I had to use the games slow mo mechanic to get past it…I really want to see this series continue so I hope unravel two does well…if we do get an unravel 3 I hope it goes back to the solo play of the first game where you had to actually manage the yarn and be more clever…this was a nice pallet cleanser but give me the real thing againI give Unravel Twoa 7.5/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/unravel-two

Year’s ago they took a simple idea and turned it into a very fun and addictive experience to be played by all and every now and then they release a new shiny version for you to get to grips with. The new version of the game is called Tempest 4000 and even though it has a few shortcomings to say once again I enjoyed my time with a new version of Tempest would be quite the understatement. Once again the gameplay is simple but very addictive and this easy to pick up and play style means gamers of all skill levels and ages can join in the fun, which is great. In terms of content the game will keep you satisfied for quite a while, but I would recommend that you wait till it drops in price a little because at the moment in my opinion it’s a little bit too expensive. Another reason why I would recommend for you to wait till it lowers in price is because there isn’t really anything new that veterans of the series won’t have seen before. That being said the content that is here has been done to perfection and it will provide you with plenty of enjoyable moments. You’ll pleased to know then that technically Tempest 4000 doesn’t suffer with any problems at all. The controls remain tight and responsive throughout your time with the game and everything else also plays out the same way which limits frustration quite a lot. This is a very good thing because the game does get very difficult quite quickly, but even though the game can be overly difficult at times I still didn’t find myself getting frustrated that much. Instead I found myself returning to the game time and time again and the addictive nature of the game is clear to see from the get go. Defeating enemies never seems to get dull and when you defeat a number of different enemies at the same time you always end up getting a very satisfying feeling. Without a doubt the most noticeable improvement over the original game’s is the presentation side of things. Tempest has never looked and sounded better and in a way the improved visuals and sound design do make the gameplay even more fun and immersive.

The developers have made the game very fun and addictive and most important of all is it’s very rewarding, which is great. In the game there are four characters for you to try out and trying them out was very fun. Each character has had a lot of thought and effort put into them and the variety each character has keeps things fresh throughout. The gameplay on the whole is super addictive and has loads of interesting concepts in play at the same time. You would expect the gameplay to be complicated because of this, but thankfully they keep things simple which makes the game accessible to a lot of gamers. Whilst it may be simple in its approach it does however get a tad too difficult at times and the difficulty seems to spike out of nowhere which can be a little frustrating at times. Thankfully though the progression system makes you forget about the difficulty and makes you determined to carry on. I say this because the progression system has been done to perfection and the best thing is that it delivers you tons of replay value. Those who are fans of the strategy side of game’s may be a little disappointed here because there isn’t much in terms of variety here unfortunately. Something that really surprised me about the game though was how fun and charming the story was. The story remains interesting throughout and the way they tell the story has a unique feel to it, which is great. The presentation side of the game ticked a lot of boxes for me and I was especially fond of the visuals. The pixel-art visuals fit the game’s style very well and the accompanying sound design also holds up really well. At the end of the day I love it when a game reaches my lofty expectations and thankfully that’s exactly what Full Metal Furies does. You can tell from the get go that a lot of love and effort has gone into the game and this makes everything about the game stand out in a good way. It’s both fun and addictive when playing on your own or with friends and the simplicity of the game means things never get too frustrating, which is something that I really liked, and without a doubt Full Metal Furies gets a massive thumbs up from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/full-metal-furies

Thankfully on the whole it performs pretty well and it does provide you with quite a few enjoyable moments but it doesn’t come without its problems as well. It does however get more things right than it gets wrong and when played with friends you end up having a huge amount of fun. The online components in the game work really well and I didn’t suffer with many problems at all. In fact the only real problem the online multiplayer suffers with is that the servers are a little empty so finding a game can be a little bit difficult at times. When you do get into a game though the gameplay can be very addictive and there is a great deal of variety in certain areas. One of the areas that has the most variety present is when it comes to the weapons you can use in the game. Each weapon has its pros and cons and they’re all fun to use and this definitely keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. Another aspect of the game that has a great deal of variety is the customisation that you’re allowed to do. You can chop and change a number of different things and this amount of freedom means no game ever plays the same, which in turn gives the game quite a bit of replay value. I will however recommend that you play the game in short bursts especially if you’re playing on your own because the missions can get a little reptetive after a bit. You will also have to deal with a high difficulty curve when playing alone and this will be off-putting for some, but I suggest that you ride it out because you will become more powerful as you progress through the game. Without a doubt one of my favourite things about the game was the presentation that has been implemented. If you like a retro look with a modern feel then this game will tick a lot of boxes for you. This look gives the game quite a bit of charm and I must admit that the visuals and sound design combined together extremely well culminating in even more fun being delivered to you. All in all this game does what it sets out to do and this is to deliver you a fun and enjoyable experience and on the whole the game works really well but I can’t help thinking that the game’s problems stop it from reaching its full potential. That being said it does enough to keep fans of this specific genre satisfied and it does enough to get a thumbs up from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/battlezone-gold-edition

In some ways it succeeds and in others it fails, but I would still recommend it to most people interested in Tower Defense/indie games with a good art style. The game is a mix between a TD and an action platformer, with 1 or 2 players controlling 2-4 characters (the number increases the farther you get into the game). Each character has specific structures that can be built (some of which require ingredients from 2 or more players), unique weapons, and a special ability. Every element can be upgraded. Personally, I challenged myself by finishing the game on 1P mode and insane difficulty without backtracking to previous levels. I suggest others do the same if they don't have a friend to play with. The game succeeds in being engaging, even if not always extremely fun. You quickly get thrown into this gameplay loop of challenge rewarded by extra story and your own choice of upgrades. In terms of story, the game is pretty good but not excellent, though it hits high notes from time to time. The characters are only decent. Outside of the story, the game has enough variance to where it hardly ever feels boring. Over time, certain structures start to be unlocked and some structures lose value as you generally have more resources available. At some point, I felt I had reason to use almost every structure, weapon, and character at least a few times. The flaws that this game does have are pretty huge. For one, there were a few minor glitches I encountered. Besides that, most levels have an exploratory phase before the tower defense phase. These are used for tutorials and puzzles (of which only a few are excellent), but hardly ever for platforming. Even the tower defense has more platforming because it requires you to collect and manage resources with a time limit. While juggling between characters to accomplish this is fun to some extent, the AI is too incompetent when you're not controlling a character. It's always rooted in once place and doesn't attack unless an enemy is very close, and when it does it's at a low firing rate. While the character combat is made more engaging by having to stay on your toes and adapt, fighting enemies usually means staying in one place and shooting. Some of the systems in place are easy to forget about. The game gives you a limited number of player hearts, but they are easily replenished so they're mostly easy to forget about. On occasion, I even forgot some of my characters had special abilities because I hardly used them. That being said, adapting around some of the game's flaws is much of what makes it so special. You have to see what works and what doesn't with your limitations and understand how to manage characters most efficiently. For example, it might be necessary to bring a character somewhere to repair buildings, another to work on a resource generator, another to stand by an enemy spawn where the enemies are of the same color so they take extra damage, and another to be controlled to extract resources. Then you can use one of the same characters as an anchor, using the ""follow"" command to bring the resource miner back more quickly. It's stressful at first, but once you get used to it it's all good, strategic fun with a huge level of depth and variety. Overall score: 7.5 out of 10",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/aegis-defenders

Coming at you with some history today. Are you into video game history? Do you remember the Apple II development days? If so I have something super special today if not it's still not a bad game today. For those of you not in the know, the Apple II was very special to early game development as it enables garage development (starting a game studio in your garage) this led to things such as wizardry which though itself was a huge leap in games and RPGs it led to another small game that started jrpgs, you might have heard of dragon quest? I heard it's kind of a small colt series of sorts or so I have heard. Lode runner legacy is a throwback to an important puzzle platformer that happened from back in the Apple II days. Lode runner may even be the first of it's kind adding puzzle elements to a platformer. It has stood the test of time over many years with many versions of the game. It was such a hit in its time that it had a championship edition and one of the first level editors Let's talk gameplay, lode runner is fairly straightforward. You can move left, right, climb up and fall down. This is how you will get around and gather coins solving movement. In addition to all of this you can drill away most bricks, there is a button for left and right but you can not dig straight down. Among all of this, there are special blocks, pitfall blocks you can fall through bu not pass through, steel which can not be dug through and trap blocks which hide enemy's within. Enemies are our list major obstacle they will chase you, steal the gold and if they touch time to start over. The only way to deal with them is to trap them to where a black will respawn over them burying alive be careful! You too can be buried alive. Lode Runner has various modes with adventure mode (story mode) it has cut scenes! Also, it's just the main gameplay in a story fashion. Puzzle mode in which it's a brain teaser with more complex layouts. A classic model is a very stylized version of the game designed to look like the dog that had the old school sound effects! Special shout out to all the original levels of lode runner and championship edition.Co-OP which is kind of like easy mode? As you work together in the new levels to achieve the same goal. Lastly, the level editor is back as it is a staple of the franchise using all of its tricks. What more is there to say, its Lode Runner very faithfully. Pros:Its Lode Runner Co-OP is neat Classic mode is an awesome addition Cons:There really are none With this all said I give this game a final rating of:10/10 It's Lode Runner not a lot to say about a legacy title like this., Just play it if you like classics or puzzle platformers and see it for yourself.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/lode-runner-legacy

I do believe however that the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. Update: With the level editor, the game definitely deserves the full 10 rather than just a 9.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/overload

You play as Otto, a kind of summoner (technically a shaper) on a mission to save the world and your betrothed ! Classic story, but the world you explore is very beautiful, feels like Moana somehow, paired with a calm soothing music. The gameplay consists of some simple puzzles, but the main interest is in battles. You can summon different types of ""guardians"" to attack the enemy, and you can attack yourself using your staff. You gain experience as you win battles (and puzzles), this helps you reinforce your skill tree both on personal skills and guardians skills. Concerning personal skills, these are mostly for your constitution/melee damage, and more importantly battle cries to boost your guardians. You (Otto) has no magic, only melee attack. You have no equipment. You can reset your skills distribution at any time. This dungeon crawler is very special in that it's pretty tactical. Each enemy will require a special strategy to win, especially on later levels. The difficulty can indeed seem infuriating later on, but I always found that by varying the composition of my team of summons, I eventually kicked the boss' ass. Other times I had fun just spamming the guy with tons of melee fighters and fighting with them, cornering the guy without mercy. You will need to stay alert in battles if you want to win good victories (there is a rank). You have to move your troops when in danger, strike when you find an opening, and so on. I beat the game in a rather completionist fashion in 13 hours, on Normal difficulty. This may seem a bit short, but I'm satisfied, and keep in mind this game is not expensive. Perfectionists can always beat the game again on Hard. Collectibles places are not contrived, and they are useful so you are encouraged to gather them. Trophy hunters will be pleased that although I'm not a hunter myself, there are only 2 hidden I have left, so getting a platinum is doable. Lastly, I found you can play the game perfectly fine with the PS4 controllers, you'll get a bit confused at first, but then everything becomes very intuitive; no need for mouse/keyboard as another review suggested.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/masters-of-anima

His request of you is to travel the United States and spread stories, which seems easy enough. You’ll traverse the land experiencing all manners of events, such as seeing children abandoned in knapsacks by their parents to winged goats protecting houses. You’ll be told stories by others, some being things that you witnessed firsthand, and you’ll be given the chance to call them out on their embellishments, or you can agree with them stating that’s what happened. In your journey you’ll also come across campfires with characters written by guest authors, such as Leigh Alexander. It’s here that you will tell the stories you come across in the hopes of learning theirs. With each successful story told, you gain their trust and you are able to learn more about them. The game unfolds like a “choose your own adventure” story, as you progress through the lands experiencing different events and decide what happens with them. Almost every encounter outside of the campfire characters is narrated by Sting, who changes his very soothing yet gruff voice for the dialogue you may encounter. The writing is phenomenal, and while I will often times skip through spoken dialogue as I’ve already read it in games, I listened to everything offered in this as if I was a child being read to again. With still images of the events being told in the game, you’re able to visualize both in your head how you want to see it based on the descriptions, but also in the direction that Jett has created. Starting out you’ll find yourself walking about the map of the United States rather slowly, but you’re soon told how to hitchhike which will help you cover a bit more ground, and eventually you’ll be able to ride on trains as well. The latter you can do illegally or by paying to do so from a major city. Just know that every choice you make has a consequence, and more often than not, every action means a story. And in this, stories are powerful – they are almost a sort of currency in the progression of the game. While you will need to obtain actual money by doing work or through other means to shop or take the train across the country, it’s hardly as important as the weight of the stories that you carry. The emotional impact of this game will certainly depend on if you let it hit you. Johnnemann Nordhage, the founder of Dim Bulb Games, is the co-founder of Fullbright and was the programmer on Gone Home. Admittedly, my experience with that game was less than amazing, as none of the lighting worked for me on my PC and the story was so built up by everyone it ended up a disappointment for me. So if you go into this expecting something along the lines of an action packed romp across the United States in the fashion of Red Dead Redemption, your expectations will never be met. However, if you go into it thinking you’ll be hearing stories that rival those of the stranger in black and other side quest characters you meet in Red Dead Redemption, which were arguably the best parts of the game, you’ll understand better just why this is so special. Even the soundtrack perfectly accompanies the experience. While I adore the art direction for the game, I can see why some would not fancy it so much. The game is comprised of a lot of still frames, or a few different frames to simulate movement. This game makes use of your imagination much more than showing you what it’s talking about, utilizing the powerful writing to create the world you see. That can certainly be frustrating for some, especially with how beautiful the art is in this. The only thing that sort of irked me while playing was encountering sections of the game that weren’t voiced. Yes, the guy that normally skips through spoken dialogue is complaining that not everything was voiced. It’s not so much that I needed it, but it really added to the game, and it was strange that a few events were missing it. Narrative heavy games have become exceedingly popular over the past decade, though it’s not often that they are executed with such pinpoint precision as this.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not a bad game by any means and it did provide me with some enjoyable moments but in the end it suffers with a few glaring problems that stop it from being placed in the higher echelons of strategy games. It does however get some aspects I consider important right, and I especially found that to be the case with the controls. The controls in the game are thankfully simple and most importantly they remained responsive throughout, which was a relief because the game is very unforgiving. In my opinion the difficulty curve is way too high and I found this to harm the fun factor quite a lot which is a shame because I did enjoy some of the content that was present in the game. Speaking about content there is quite a lot for you to get to grips with and when you finally manage to get past the hard-core difficulty you will find yourself having quite a few enjoyable moments. Unfortunately though these moments don’t seem to last long and that’s mainly down to the tedious combat in the game. The main reason why I’ve labelled the combat tedious is because everything about it feels slow and clunky and in the end you just end up getting bored, which is a shame. The enemies also don’t help when it comes to the combat side of things and that’s mainly down to each enemy pretty much playing out the same way and the lack of variety becomes quite noticeable almost immediately. Thankfully there is something that does have quite a bit of variety and that thing is the story. I found the story to be very charming and it kept me interested more than I thought it would and I think that was because the story has a nice amount of humour included. Another thing I found to be charming about the game was the presentation. The visuals and sound design are perfect in my opinion and in a way they make the game have a unique edge to it, which is great. At the end of the day Masters of Anima could have been so much more and it would’ve been much more if it didn’t have the problems it unfortunately has. These problems spoil the fun factor and make things become a chore, which is a shame because they do get quite a lot right. If you’re a fan of strategy games then you will find something in this game that will tickle your fancy and despite its problems it probably just does enough to get a small recommendation from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/masters-of-anima

Thankfully The Fall Part 2: Unbound is a fantastic continuation of the series and without a doubt it satisfied me a great deal. The story is once again the thing that stands out most. Everything about the story is fantastic and the best thing is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. One of the reasons the story is so successful is because the characters in the game are a joy to behold and for me they are some of the best characters I’ve ever come across in a game. When it comes to the gameplay that’s on offer in the game you will notice a number of different mechanics in play at the same time, and thankfully most of these different mechanics hold up really well. I never found myself getting bored with the gameplay, but I would have liked a little more variety when it came to the combat in the game. Don’t get me wrong the combat isn’t bad but I would have liked them to have made it a little less frustrating. Once again there are an abundance of puzzles for you to get to grips with in the game, and thankfully some of these puzzles are amazing. What you will notice is that each puzzle matters and the clever design of each puzzles makes completing them very rewarding. There isn’t much bad about this game but I will say that it does suffer with a few technical issues every now and then, but a small patch would sort this out easily. In terms of the presentation side of the game it ticked a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a dark sinister side to it and I think it creates a very unique atmosphere. The sound design also manages to create a unique atmosphere as well and I thought the voice actors did a wonderful job with their roles. At the end of the day Over The Moon have done a wonderful job with part 2 of this fascinating series, and in some ways they’ve even made it better than the first game. Everything about this game just feels right and when everything that’s right combines together it delivers a very memorable experience. If you enjoyed the first game then The Fall Part 2: Unbound is an absolute must buy and I can’t wait to see what the series has planned for us next.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-fall-part-2-unbound

As you can imagine then whenever a game has a World War II theme I’m very eager to get to grips with it and the best thing about the new game Bomber Crew that’s made its way to the Xbox One is that it focuses on the flying side of war. Decent flying game’s are very few and far between and thankfully Bomber Crew can be added to the decent flying game’s list despite the shortcomings it suffers with. One thing that impressed me right from the get go were the strategy elements the game boasts. Each move and little different thing you do matters in the long run so when you end up completing a mission you end up getting a great sense of achievement. This sense of achievement though also has some frustrating moments thrown in as well because the game’s difficulty curve can be quite difficult at times. The awkward controls also don’t help when it comes to the frustration levels as well and you’ll find that it will take you quite a while to get used them. When you do get used to them though you will be pleased with the amount of content that’s available to you. There is more than enough to keep you satisfied for quite a while and even though the missions do get repetetive after a while completing them still gives you a nice little rush. As you progress through the various missions the game delivers a number of different upgrades and unlockables to you and without a doubt obtaining each different upgrade is worth it which means the game does have quite a bit of replayability. Whilst I was impressed with the upgrades and unlockables some of them do require a lot of grinding to obtain and this can make things become a little tedious and repetetive. I must admit though that I was glad I carried on despite the repetetiveness because each upgrade did make the game a little easier, which is great. On the presentation side of things Bomber Crew isn’t going to win any awards but I actually enjoyed what was on offer here. Visually the game has a nice cute cartoony style and the accompanying sound design combines well with these visuals making the gameplay even more fun in a way. At the end of the day Bomber Crew has quite a few interesting mechanics in play at the same time and in a way this does give the game a little bit of uniqueness. This uniqueness means that you can look past the game’s imperfections and in the end you end up having quite an enjoyable time with Bomber Crew.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/bomber-crew

Mulaka does get this right at times and if it didn’t suffer with the shortcomings it has then it would be an even better game. The world in which the game takes place in is absolutely fantastic in my opinion. Exploring the world never seemed tedious and it has a decent size to it, so you can enjoy yourself somewhat. You will notice however that the more you explore the more technichal issues the game suffers with, and whilst none of these are major issues they can still be a nuisance at times. The gameplay that’s on offer in Mulaka has a decent variety to it and when all the mechanics click together you end up having some enjoyable combat and puzzles to sink your teeth into. Unfortunately though the controls can be a little awkward at times and the movement can also feel a little awkward and that can take away from the fun factor every now and then. Without a doubt my favourite thing about this game were the boss battles. The boss battles were absolutely awesome and the thought and effort that has gone into them is evident from the get go, and by doing this they’ve made each different boss stand out. The same can also be said about the other enemies you face and the amount of variety is excellent when it comes to the enemy design. The game unfortunately isn’t blessed when it comes to the amount of content it has and in my opinion it was a little on the short side, and I definitely would have liked to have been able to do a little more. The lack of content means the game doesn’t have much in terms of replayability so once completed your highly unlikely to return back to it. The presentation side of the game is something that ticked a lot of boxes for me. Visually the game has a lot of unique charm and the art style can look beautiful at times. The sound design has also been done well and it does a very good job of drawing you into the game. At the end of the day I appreciate the effort that has gone into Mulaka and if it didn’t have the niggling problems it has it would have definitely gotten a higher score from me. That being said despite its problems it does provide you with a very enjoyable experience and for that reason it does enough to get a thumbs up from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/mulaka

Along the way they must not only survive but gain treasures and weapons needed to survive. The game does offer plenty of weapons form pistols to dynamite and of course shotguns and all manner of machines guns. While this may at first seem a bit of overkill, it is not as players will need this and more to stop the enemies that face them. Players will also be able to gain treasures as they journey and battle which can be used at a market to purchase upgrades and special weapons which will greatly help their efforts in battle.The gameplay and the story is very simplistic and very retro in the gameplay. The controls at times are not as responsive as I would have liked while at other times they respond faster than you would anticipate which is a pain when facing waves of enemies in a close setting and with a weapon using a slower than expected reload time. Graphically the game is solid but do not expect AAA quality graphics as this is very much a retro game so while they are better than the previously mentioned Serious Sam, they would not hold up when compared to other shooters of the day. However as a value priced title which can be picked up for your PC or Console for under $12.00 in many places, Immortal Redneck is a pleasant enough trip down memory lane which should keep shooter fans happy with retro nostalgic fun. 3 stars out of 5.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/immortal-redneck

If that’s how you feel, it’s entirely possible you have not seen the likes of Gravity Falls, The Amazing World of Gumball, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and other things that have been created by those that grew up loving the culture during the same time period. Of course, that love goes both ways, as the same people are also enjoying those new cartoons and making games inspired by them. My wife hasn’t seen much of the aforementioned cartoons, if at all. In fact, I believe she’s only seen an episode or two of Adventure Time, and that was years ago when we were dating. However, she picked up on the influences in The Adventure Pals immediately. The aesthetic of the game, the humor, and the characters themselves are certainly reminiscent. Is that a bad thing? By no means, as it creates an experience that feels like an interactive cartoon. And the humor is very much like cartoons these days – able to be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. The game starts off with your dad being kidnapped by a Mr. B (he rides on a bee) who is turning older folks into hotdogs. Not hotdogs that you’ll eat, mind you – sentient, human-sized frankfurters. The price for their return? A few rubies. To obtain these rubies you’ll be completing levels within a world map that you traverse on your giraffe that you’re gifted by your dad on your birthday. To unlock certain levels, you’ll need to be given tasks from the local townsfolk, all with their own issues. This adds a bit of levity to the experiences, as the dialogue does not shy away from being overtly silly. The writing uses a fair amount of references while also being original. First and foremost, this is a platformer. While you’ll be talking with a variety of NPCs and getting quests from them like in an RPG, but the majority of the game involves jumping off walls, killing enemies with your sword, and utilizing your giraffe and pet rock to explore the environments utilizing their different abilities. On top of that, in your quests you’ll be earning experience that will allow you to choose new abilities to help with your exploration. Some of these help with your combat abilities, others allow you to avoid death in certain circumstances, while others help with the collection of things like coins and experience. The game starts off at a difficulty level that may seem a bit too easy, but it ramps up a bit as the game progresses. At the end of collecting the land’s five rubies you’ll be faced with a boss; these are expectedly the hardest part of the game if you let them be. While they are the most difficult, that doesn’t mean they are the best or most fun parts. The first boss you encounter has several moves that he repeats in the same routine, and despite knowing what was coming, I continually took damage despite not seeing any connection between the obstacles and myself. Luckily, the game provides you with items like bombs, health potions, and invulnerability potions. These are easily acquired which makes the boss battles easy should you choose to use them. Knowing exactly when to hit the boss, simply putting on the invincibility and waiting for the vulnerable timeframe takes the boss battles from somewhat difficult to a bit of a joke. In addition to simply completing the levels you’ll have the opportunity to collect things like cupcakes and stickers within the levels. The cupcakes allow for you to buy new costumes which don’t have any effect other than changing your appearance, but they are amusing and a nice reward for the collection process. On top of the normal experience, you can jump into this adventure with your own pals. That’s right, the game has co-op for those that wish to battle old people turned wieners with friends in the hopes of saving your father and mother from the same fate. Most of the game’s mechanics work well and the levels are fun to play through; the main complaint here is that they seem a bit simple. The collection of cupcakes and stickers don’t take much effort in comparison to things like Super Meat Boy or Celeste. Indeed, this means it’s more accessible for those that dislike games that are overly difficult, but it leaves me wanting a bit more, especially with level scores being A+ without any trouble. Additionally, some of the platforming can be a bit dodgy when it comes to smaller platforms because unlike Mega Man, your jump is a bit unpredictable. Luckily your giraffe allows you to slow your fall and more accurately land your jumps. In a world of video game inspired cartoons and cartoon inspired video games, it’s no wonder that The Adventure Pals exists. Mixing the love for things like Adventure Time, older platformers, and humor with a modern touch makes for an enjoyable experience. While not a perfect game, it does a lot right and is great for some parent/child bonding.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-adventure-pals

The environments are beautiful, and if you're lucky enough to know Swedish you'll have a couple of extra laughs over things found written here and there, as well as a nice feeling of being home in this warped post apocalypse like version of Stockholm. The controls works nicely, and I was glad to find you can change settings to drawing your bow with left hand. Shooting the bow, dodging and blocking attacks with a shield feels pretty cool.

Very quickly I wondered why there couldn't just have been an ""open"" button to press instead of having to type it repeatedly. Also the terminals where you type this have a small font, and whenever I leaned closer to read it the game auto adjusted its position so the terminal popped away from me and I had to bend over double to squint at it at a distance. All the information is however stored and readable in your home base, and there the font is large and easy to read. I could not find any subtitles for the game which is kind of a bummer, maybe there will be in a later patch. The game feels intuitive, immersive and engaging. Is it the best game ever made?

Whether you love them or hate them, these games offer a unique way of telling a story, but rarely have much gameplay value in the traditional sense. The new title Shape of the World takes on the more difficult task of asking the audience to play with no real story to be told. So what is the point of the game? Well, I’m not really sure and I’ve managed to complete it, although it seems to be for relaxation. I feel like the game alludes to you being God in some way or another, turning a blank canvas into a living breathing world. You will collect seeds, which you can in turn throw to make fully fledged trees appear in the blink of an eye. With the right trigger you can also destroy, or interact in some cases, with the same foliage. Interacting with large stones causes strange stairwells to appear, often leading to another area or the current objective which is a triangle that will appear as you get closer, often being visible through other in game assets. The controls are extremely accessible due to the basic nature of the game. While you can jump using a face button, it is rarely needed. The bulk of your time will simply be using the sticks to move and look around, with the triggers working to create or destroy/use as I mentioned previously. The controls work well, but movement speed is often sluggish which makes you feel as if you’re in waist deep mud. There are no true enemies to encounter, nor is death a thing in the game. You will occasionally encounter a living being, which all start out small as if they are larger versions of a single cell organism, and eventually become large whales swimming through the sky. That said, the game plays out much like what I would assume would be your best (or worst) acid trip. You can interact with most of the creatures, but few will actually do much of anything other than occasionally push you off of a ledge or allow you to use them as a trampoline of sorts to jump higher into the air. I’m not sure if this was how it was intended, but shooting seeds at them to create trees would often stop them from pushing me away from my goal. Similar to the typical walking sim which relies on the story to drive the player forward, this uses a combination of calming ambient music with its stylized, yet detailed visual style. The game uses a unique visual trick that I haven’t seen used much in any medium since my freshman year of art school. I will spare you the technical term, but when you use multiple colors of the same intensity with different hues, it causes the brain to see the illusion of depth within a 2D space. While this makes for some stunning visuals, it does leave some like me with a grueling headache. This lingered with me for hours after completing the game. Despite the fact that it felt like someone was taking a power drill to my head, I managed to complete the game in less than two hours. While there are collectibles, as well as additional areas tucked away to be found that encourages players to revisit the world, this will likely not be enough for most gamers. I consider myself to be an individual with higher than average intelligence and am still puzzled by the ending. I’m not sure if there is a deep seeded story that I am not getting, or you are simply on a journey taking in the sights and sounds working your way from point A to point B over and over again. Either way, I would recommend picking up the title once the price drops a little, as the $14.99 price point feels a bit high due to the lack of content offered.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/shape-of-the-world

The fact that both characters look completely identical is a huge point of frustration, which often caused my partner and me to be lost as to who was doing what. By default, the game offers an extremely panned out viewpoint, making large sections of the small islands you visit to be visible at all times. This works well in the single player portion of the title, but in co-op it zooms out even further, making a game that is already difficult to navigate at times even harder to view. The premise of the game follows your nameless, featureless, quite frankly boring protagonist(s) as they set forth to free their people from the clutches of their equally bland villains. You'll start the game in a decently sized hub world that houses the level select, as well as some areas fit for exploring, or racing through which we will discuss in a bit. You'll start the game with a few areas available, while others will be added as you progress. Each level is a small area comprised of an island or group of islands, each with three objectives: destroy specific objects, save your captive friends, and collect shimmering green crystals. Completing these will open the option to run through the level in a time trial that omits all of the previous objectives and feels like it was tacked on for no reason other than to extend the longevity of the title. To complete your objectives, you'll need to use items found within the game world to progress through barriers and walls, such as switches, pressure plates, and the standard puzzle tropes including vehicles and the all too familiar red barrels that explode if you hit them too hard. Mugsters offers no direction whatsoever, so you will have to rely on your own wits to progress. Progression in itself is not overly difficult if you use common sense, with the collectible hunting being the largest challenge. The levels are designed in a way that you don't always see the obvious path needed to make it to areas just out of reach, and standing a van or a bus is not an option, although the characters appear to be able to reach them and simply just slide off. The same can be said for ledges that appear to be within reach, meaning you have to complete the game in the manner it was designed to be, despite it seemingly offering the freedom to complete the tasks any way you choose. The biggest frustration is the lemming quality that the NPCs you will have to rescue on your journey, where they will randomly walk head first into danger or ignore the fact that a car or barrel right next to them is about to explode. Stray too far from them or walk to close to an in game asset and you'll likely lose them or forget they are even there. The one time they seem to exhibit any type of intelligence is when you get into one of the many cars spread out around the level, but you must keep in mind they won't remove themselves hastily in the event you want to use the vehicle as a high powered explosive to take down a wall or run over a barrel, which typically makes the smaller methods of transport explode immediately. Regardless of how you play the title, be it solo or with friends, the campaign is exactly the same. While I found that playing with my wife managed to speed up the time it took to complete the objectives, the issues I mentioned previously did not really make the experience something I would want to play again and again. Playing with my young son was equally frustrating, primarily due to the driving mechanics. The controls work, albeit feel a bit sluggish, but the driving mechanics are quite taxing, forcing the player to steer left or right while moving within a 3D space. Since each level requires you to escape via a plane that can be found at the end of the level, this is something that can end in epic failure, often after you've completed all of the objectives that the level requires. Sure, you're not out much time due to the failure, but some of the puzzles require constant backtracking on foot to complete and no mid-level checkpoints are present. Much like the overall package, the presentation is hit or miss. I've already called out the fact the enemies and protagonists are bland and quite boring, but when the individual levels are so well designed visually, it makes this stand out as a fault even more. The cel-shaded environments are aesthetically pleasing and well rounded, despite getting fairly repetitive early on with repeated designs lasting a lot longer than I would've liked to see. The music and sound effects found within the game are forgettable – having just beat the game a few hours prior to writing this, nothing stands out as memorable. Mugsters is not a bad game by any means, with the steering controls being the standout performance issue; the overall package is simply mediocre and lacks any unique factors to make it standout in any meaningful way.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/mugsters

While not perfect, this is the best motorcycle based game ever made.  Add in more bikes from the 60s-80s and you would actually be getting closer to a perfect score.4. The physics of the game are outstanding and the best yet.5. Graphics are not on par with Forza, but they are nevertheless fantastic...again, best yet for a motorcycle game.6.

Because a) there is a lot of effort in it, and b) it has strength that make up for these flaws a thousandfold. I am not going to explain anything about the story, because the story is the major strength of this game.The gameplay itself is slightly different from part 1. While the point and click adventure elements are still in place (and in my opinion they got implemented in very clever ways, eclipsing part 1), the fighting system got a major overhaul. It plays more like an NES Metroid titles by now, with some more polish.Let me be straight here: The fighting gameplay is not amazing, but it is entertaining enough. The biggest flaw here is that fights happen a tad too often (so they become redundant), but it isn't all that bad. The important thing is that the gameplay, at any point, goes hand in hand with the story. There is no riddle just to have gameplay, every little part of the game is either done for pacing between two story segments or part of the story. And since the story is one of the best I have seen in science fiction games (at least in short ones), that was a good design choice. While you might not really see the appeal in the early moments of the game, exspecially the ending gets a lot of pay off from earlier parts (which is nto to say earlier parts are not wellcrafted). Personally, I was really flashed by some of the things the developer did with the game and didn't regret a moment to having bought it. Another thing you can see is that in this indie game, there is clearly a lot of effort invested.The developer didn't have a huge team, but there were many moments in the game where i thought that the developer polished the game to the utmost of his abilities and never took the lazy route. So while this game has some flaws, the charme of it and the amazing story should really convince you to at least take a look.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-fall-part-2-unbound

I love games like Darkest Dungeon and X-com for their resource management side and rich lore but what I love about these kinds of games is that they don't hold you hand and THEY LET YOU FAIL. I love the fact that there are situations where you cannot progress without losing something you've worked for - this is something cultist simulator provides. Another amazing part of this game is the lack of a tutorial, which increases the immersion 20 fold, you have to discover what is going on, learn the systems, and find ways to overcome challenges with no hand holding. This is one of the only modern games i've played that has done something like this and it was incredibly refreshing and enjoyable. the systems here are very intuitive as well, there were many times in game when I thought ""i should be able to do this"" and I was able to do exactly that. There were so many moments where I was simply blown away by the design of this game. One of my favorite games ever. Raised the bar for all other resource management games I'll ever play.

From the moment I started reviewing Impact Winter I realised straight away why it got mixed reviews because it gets some things right and it gets quite a few things wrong, but thankfully it got more things right than it got wrong. Obviously the most important aspect of this game is its survival elements and thankfully they’ve done a pretty good job here. The mechanics hold up really well and they do a good job of keeping you on your toes throughout. I was however expecting more depth from the survival side of the game and if you’re looking for more tasks and methods then there are better games out there for you to pursue. Thankfully though they combat the lack of depth in the survival aspect by offering you some decent quests. The quests in the game have a lot of variety going for them and that made each quest both interesting and exciting, which in turn makes you want to carry on and it also gives the game some replayability. There is a story that’s present as you make your way through the quests and sometimes it can be quite interesting, but it does have a drawback. The drawback is that there just isn’t enough of a story and this means the characters aren’t as interesting as they could’ve been, which is a shame. One thing they do make interesting though is the world in which the game takes place in. The world is full of secrets throughout and exploring the world is very fun because you don’t know what you will bump into along the way. Whilst I found the world very enjoyable you will come across a few technichal issues as you progress. None of these issues are game-breaking but there are quite a few of them and they can frustrate you which ultimately harms the immersion levels somewhat. That’s a shame because the presentation side of the game creates a lot of immersion and I really enjoyed this aspect of the game. The visuals and sound design combine together extremely well and without a doubt it gives Impact Winter a certain charm which stays with you throughout your time with the game. At the end of the day Impact Winter has many enjoyable moments for you to find and it’s a pretty decent game, but the shortcomings stop it from reaching its full potential and in the end there are better games for you to try out in the genre. Fans of the genre though will find a lot of things to satisfy them and most of its problems could be sorted out with a patch so it still does enough to get a recommendation from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/impact-winter

You are Otto, an apprentice Shaper of Anima, who simply seek to marry your fiance, Ana. The problem is that she is the Supreme Shaper and has been taken captive by the evil Zahr. Zahr’s plan is to destroy all other shapers and free Mount Spark, bringing darkness to the land. After Zahr’s devastating attack on the Shapers you are the only able bodied warrior left, you must go on a quest to save Ana, who has been split into heart, mind and body. GameplayThe Gameplay consists of non-combat sections and combat sections that are  spaced throughout a series of  levels. The sections balance each other out and keep each other from becoming boring or tedious. Both of these sections revolve around creating and commanding minions called Guardians to achieve your goal.During the non-combat sections, you are solving puzzles and collecting upgrades as well as collectables. You summon Guardians to help you complete the puzzles and find secrets. As you progress through the story, more and more types of guardians are put at your disposal. There are a variety of guardians that each have unique abilities, such as archers who can hit distant targets and psychics who can create protective barriers. This keeps the gameplay from getting stale. It’s very fun to command several groups of your minions to do different things in order to complete a task at once, I just wish there were more instances in which this occurred. More commonly, you are just ordering one group of guardians to do something so you can proceed. This is still fun, just less so. One issue I had that wasn’t a bug was the archers, called Sentinels, firing at targets they did not have a clear path to hit, making them endless shoot into an obstacle such as a wall. Also, targeting things off the ground can be confusing as you must point to the ground they are over. Lastly, the direction in which you role does not follow the direction you are moving, it follows the direction in which your cursor is pointing. This may not sound like a big deal, but if you are in the middle of a battle and you are trying to simultaneously dodge enemy fire and order guardians, this can be the difference between taking damage or not. It is also just generally annoying for when you are trying to move around the map quickly. These annoyed me but are certainly not deal breakers and could be easily fixed/changed.During the combat sections, you are fighting Zahr’s minions. These consist of mini-boss fights. You command your guardians to attack the enemy while you try to keep yourself and your guardians alive. You can use the terrain to your advantage by buffing your guardians. You have to be careful though, because the enemy may destroy the terrain while attacking. This is a great feature as it adds another layer of strategy to the game. Each combat section ends by giving you a grade on how well you did. I liked this, because it encouraged me to do better, even if I won the battle.At the end of each level, you can upgrade yourself as well as your guardians. This is nice as it allows you to customize your play style by upgrading the units you use the most.Overall, the gameplay is fun and engaging. Graphics/ArtworksThe art style really appeals to me. It's not the 16-bit pixel art, and it’s not the high definition realistic art of triple-A titles, it boasts a unique style. There’s not much else to say here. I just really liked it. PerformanceThe game performs quite well on my gaming computer. The resolution was good and the framerate was always high. Over the course of my playtime I encountered only two very minor bugs. Both of these involved guardians in places where they shouldn't have been, but didn’t really take away from the experience. OverallOverall I really enjoyed Masters of Anima. The graphics, story, and voice acting really took me in to the fantasy settings. The core mechanic of commanding guardians is executed well and is very fun. The practice of commanding minions to do your bidding may seem similar to pikmin, but I think there is enough other mechanics that really make this game quite unique. There are only a few, easy to fix bugs. I give Masters of Anima an 8/10. It doesn’t completely knock my socks off, but it is a very strong and enjoyable game.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/masters-of-anima

The goofy humor and characters may turn some off, but I found the cheesiness to be pretty charming. The exploration, unfortunately, can drag a little at times, with many of the battles being too similar or having arbitrary rules (you must finish this battle in X amount of turns... but why? There's never a story reason or, say, something that blows up if you don't. The requirement is just tacked on for no discernible reason.) The forced march through the game (you're required to accomplish 5-7 tasks per chapter, and you're on the clock) adds an element of tension to playing, although I discovered that you can pre-complete these tasks so that they count over into the next chapter, which was helpful. If I had one problem it's that the game largely abandons this structure in the last chapter and kind of just drags on for a while. Maybe some players will find tidying up loose ends at their own pace satisfying, but for me it lost any sense of urgency. I enjoyed expanding my town and bonding with my companions, and the mini-text adventures that pop up in dungeons were amusingly written and a welcome diversion from battling. Voice acting ranges from entertaining to kind of sketchy; a couple characters have pretty grating voices, but overall it's decent. All in all, I really enjoyed my time in Regalia and I intend to jump back in for a second playthrough, as it isn't possible to collect all the characters in one run. I'm hoping for a sequel in which a greater diversity can be added to the battles.

So in a sence it's more RPG heavy of the storm games with it being required to do a mission twice to unlock the bonus requirmnts were as later storm games had it on the first try if your skilled enough. Those who never played storm will find that the combat is to get used to before you can truely master it's mechanics. There is a wallrunning battle mechanic on certian maps but this is the only storm game to do this... In fact it would be easier to say what was only to this storm game. 1. Full Open World were you can climb up buildings and wall run, the later storm games have open world but in an open world sence of an RPG were you cant really climb anything but can still punch, throw shurican and jump but its not that special compared to the first game.2. Wallrunning - Storm 2-4 removed it complety.3. Minigames - This is the only storm game with mini games like tree climbing and forest running, both with their own obsticals.4. Justu clash - the only game were a chidori and a rasangan can clash and you can mash the buttons.5. Battle intros were your characters would talk an intro speech before the fight.6. Longer ultimate justus, they kind of brought it back in storm generations and 4 with the introduction of team ulitmate justus but for the most part the ulitmate justus were signifently shorter due to the character roster expanding. Thats about it, the rest was the same for the other storm games. Such as the higlight of the storm games were in fact the boss battles and watching the amazing QTE (Quick Time Event) button press for an epic cinimatic and more highly exagurated than the actual show. Storm 1 did this but very little, the QTE in storm 1 were very short and the boss fights were not that impressive. Still, a very fun expirence storm 1 was. Sound - Bandai re-uses a lot of their old sound effects for all their games. They reused the Voice Actors from the hack series as well as music and sound effects to the ultimate ninja series, continuing to re-use it all the way to the storm games. Yes even the final storm game re-uses them. Overall they are ok, could have used some different OST though. Graphics - Been downgraded for the switch but still looks fantastic. On the PS3 those graphics were awsome, much more detailed than storm 2 when it took a graphics dip but a larger character roster. Overall they are great. Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 Story - Covers the start of shippuden all the way to the end of the pain ark. Gameplay - Same as storm 1 but with all those things that were exlusive to storm 1 were removed in 2. It has better fighting though, a bigger character roster, and most of all had the best QTE boss fights in any anime game ever made. Sound - same Graphics - look at storm 1 review Naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 3 Story - Picks up the next ark all the way until the 4th ninja war ark and ends with a non cannon ending.... Because content I guess. Shorter than the 2nd game kind of. Gameplay - it was defently overhauled with having a varity of new gameplay features (such as instant awaking with their own special attacks, true awaking, support types like attack, deffense or support, no more substitution spam with having only 4 sub bars, tailed beast awakenings, etc) with storm generations refining it and storm 4 perfecting it. Overall it had WAY better gameplay than storm 1 and 2. Oh yes and this was the first storm game to introduce DLC I think. Storm 2 may or may not have had DLC costumes, dunno cant remeber. It had a bunch of costume DLC and 1 additional senaro DLC of that fantastic sasuke/itachi vs kabuto fight. Sound - skip Graphics - was defently improved in the full burst version of the game. It was much more noticable in the improved QTE boss fights which they just made them even more amazing. Overall this is a great game to play on the go (storm 1 and 2 were really grindy) Please support bandai and buy this game as someone who played the original games.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-trilogy

But it’s nowhere near close to being any good.This game tells the story of a photographer during the Iranian revolution that started in the summer of 1978. The game starts out by telling you that its base on real stories, real people, and real events…The story has its fair share of twists and turns, but it’s just not ever good…There’s a decent cast of characters here…. But aside from your main character, there’s not nearly enough  time to develop them to make decisions in this game as impactful as they should be…By the end of the game I really had no idea who’s side I was on, but the game makes you choose…You also have to make a choice out of nowhere towards the middle of the game of who betrayed the group and you have little to no information, connection, or time spent with these characters to even make an educated guess..All of these moments if huge decision making is what makes this game a little enjoyable, I just wish I spent more time with the characters I have to make decisions for, because I ultimately ended up feeling like I was just going through the motions of a poorly delivered story...The choices here during dialog is handled poorly as well..You have little to no time to think, you have to react to statements and situations almost instantly which I don’t have a problem with... but the developers made the mistake of make you point the analog stick in the direction of your choice and then press x to choose it…And I feel like this is the slowest possible way to handle decision making in a game, and with such a short timer this lead to too many moments of my character not saying anything.I really hope this game can be patched with choices being tied to separate action buttons like they are in the telltale games to make for a more smooth experience…Though either way I feel like dialog choices don’t do much to shape the world around you... it really just comes down to decisions of passiveness or aggression during key moments of the story that can change things even little..Outside of choosing dialog there are brief moments of walking around and interacting with the world a little...This is where the game does what I feel is the coolest part, there are moments for you to take pictures and after doing so the real picture from the real life event shows up on the side, and I felt this really brought life into this game.. it helped immerse me into this world that on its own has a rough time doing…Overall 1979 Revolution Black Friday just isn’t an interesting or enjoyable game…it’s a disappointment from start to finish…It functions..

The game takes place during Christmas time, so I guess now was as good a time as any to play it! You play as Calvin, a low level scientist at a research institution in a fictional city in New Hampshire. He checks into work one day, is lead into a testing room where he plays some bars by Bach and Beethoven on a piano before blacking out. He awakes sometime later to learn that an experiment being conducted in the institution has gone off the rails, leaving some characters dead, some who have gone insane and leaves Calvin questioning his own mental state. It's then up to him to find out what's happened and shut the experiment down. Overall, the story ends up being just alright, the writing is also just alright and there's no voice acting, so you're fed dialogue through text dumps. The game also has dialogue options, most of them don't matter, save for a few encounters towards the end of the game. The art direction is well done, even though it's pixel art, they were able to render some truly horrifying and unnerving scenes such as a guy blowing his brains out with a handgun, to a guy hanging himself with Christmas lights, to a person being lit on fire, among other things. The pixel art environments are highly detailed and the lighting and piano-heavy, musical score create a dark and unnerving atmosphere. While the game is a 2D side-scroller, it also borrows some classic point-and-click adventure game mechanics as well; hunt for items, use item or combine items to use on objects to solve a puzzle and progress the story. The game features a lot of monotonous backtracking through mostly the same science lab environment to find the items you need. I found the puzzle solving to be kind of frustrating, since the game doesn't really hold your hand with any of it. This was a huge drawback for me and it made me realize this part of the game is definitely not for me. The game also has some survival horror elements as well where you can sometimes find yourself being chased by a crazed cenobite-looking, machete-wielding murderer and your only options are to run, hide or die. I really wish this game expanded on it's story and it's world a lot more than it did. The game gives you some brief moments of this when you're walking outside or talking to people in a diner or store, but then it drops you right back into the same science lab environments with item hunting. The Long Reach's art direction and music certainly drew me in and enticed me to keep playing, but the game's tedious backtracking through samey environments, item hunting and puzzle solving left me feeling more frustrated than rewarded. Couple that with a story that's just okay, underdeveloped characters that I had no investment in and it's roughly 2 hour run time that left the world feeling kind of underdeveloped and overall, I can really only offer a recommendation if the game is bought for super cheap or if classic point-and-click adventure games are your thing.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/the-long-reach

Thankfully my friends got it right and as far as bullet hell game’s go Earth Atlantis is a pretty decent addition to the genre. With these types of game’s you don’t tend to get much of a story, but Earth Atlantis doesn’t follow this usual formula. In fact the story in this game is not only fresh but it also remains interesting throughout your time with the game, which is great. One thing you will notice with this game is the amount of variety it has. There is literally a lot of variety dotted in all areas from the enemies to the places you visit and this meant that I hardly ever got bored when playing this game. I will say though that the game is best enjoyed when played in short periods because it can get a little repetetive, but on the whole this isn’t a major problem because the gameplay is easy to drift in and out of. Speaking about the gameplay I was very impressed with the simplistic approach they went with. This game is not complicated and you will find that by them doing it this way you can watch and enjoy each different mechanic freely without too much pressure being put onto you. This is a very good thing because the boss fights are challenging to say the least. I will admit that I think some of you will be put off by the challenge the bosses bring to you, but thankfully this wasn’t the case with me. I found each boss battle to be a very exciting affair and once I defeated a boss a got a great sense of achievement, which is awesome. In terms of gripes with the game I only really have one and that is the map system. The map system is very frustrating to say the least because it never seems to help you out and at times it’s hard to know where to go next which can harm the immersion levels a little bit. Thankfully though the immersion levels never dwindle too much thanks to the game’s excellent presentation. Visually the game has a very unique look to it and when you combine both the visuals and sound design together they end up making the adventure even more of an enjoyable experience. At the end of the day Earth Atlantis is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and that’s mainly because they get the important aspects of the game spot on. It’s a game that is fun and challenging at the same time and if you have any interest in the bullet hell formula then I fully recommend that you give this game a try.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/earth-atlantis

The story is just as campy as the games that inspired the title with laughable dialogue and an endless number of dimwitted criminals to pummel. Spanning a respectable nine levels, the game can be finished in under 2 hours with 2 different endings depending on where you fall within the Good Cop/Bad Cop rating (we'll get to this later), which means it never overstays it's welcome. Each level culminates with at least one boss battle per the standard for this long forgotten genre. The heroes you'll play as are varied and clearly modeled after Axel/Adam, Blaze, and Skate, each with their own pros and cons - a well-rounded character, a quicker fighter with less damage to compensate, as well as the small guy who is super quick but requires many more hits to dispatch the criminals. Each fighter has a fair number of attacks: punches, kicks, dash attacks, throws, a grab move, jump attacks, and a super move that can be used to clear huge areas of enemies. These work well and provide enough variety to keep the action from getting stale; the only downfall is the special move requires a fair chunk of your health to use. It wouldn't be a true beat-‘em-up without random weapons being dropped to assist you, and they drop quite often, almost in comical amounts at times. You'll find a huge range of weapons dropped at random, as well as the occasional vehicle that can be used to dispatch huge waves of enemies with ease. The only downside to these is many can only be used a single time, breaking upon use, but this will vary depending on the item. The biggest change to the standard formula this genre is known for is the Good Cop/Bad Cop system as well as level specific challenges, such as not dying, reaching a high score, collecting a certain number of pick-ups, or dispatching enemies in a certain way. Each level will feature a number of enemies that will flash red or just simply be stunned after taking a set amount of damage. Once stunned, you can press the grab button to arrest the criminal, earning Good Cop points and resulting in an extra life or health being dropped. On the opposite end, you can earn Bad Cop points by using a weapon on the offending enemy. This system doesn't work as well in action, as a number of the highlighted enemies will fall prior to being stunned, no matter how careful you are. The enemies’ attacks are prone to friendly fire which can also result in a failed arrest or even stopping the motion resulting in a resisted arrest. You can replay each level, with the game saving your best run for each level on each available difficulty if you wish to try for a perfect game; however, this doesn't make up for when the game robs you of your action resulting in you needing to restart the level entirely. I found the presentation to be outstanding with the game’s old school meets new school vibe, with highly detailed characters that reminded me of a more fluid style of the more obscure ClayFighter. Each level or character has clear nods to previous brawlers from yesteryear, which makes this seem as if Sega themselves finally released a follow up to their long dormant series. The game can be played in couch co-op with an additional player, but not having a third player or offering online gameplay is a bit of a missed opportunity. Additionally, the title gives the players a bank of continues that can be used, which are shared between the 2 players. This can prove to be a bit of an issue if you're playing with a youngster or someone who isn't as skilled despite the title being overly accessible. While I did not find the default difficulty to be overly challenging, the easy setting proved to be a bit much for my son, resulting in us needing to start the game over once he used our entire bank of continues by the game’s climax. I give the developers kudos for allowing the player to turn off friendly fire, as it's easy to lose your characters among the chaos, or if you have a partner like my son, who thinks it's hilarious to punch your partner in the face anytime the opportunity arises. If you wish to duke it out with your child, sibling, or friend, a duel mode is also offered, which neither takes away nor adds to the title. Since Sega will likely never return to the Streets of Rage franchise, this is probably the closest we'll ever get to a true sequel. While it has its imperfections, there is a lot to enjoy with the title at a low cost of admission. I strongly recommend purchasing Raging Justice on your platform of choice.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/raging-justice

This can definitely become a nuisance and a letdown for plenty of players. While I didn't suffer from those, I did find them slightly out of place or annoying at times, but there were also some good ones, too.This game certainly isn't perfect as an actual game, yet the plot kept me totally gripped and wanting more, and I felt that for this type of games, there was an OK balance between ""plot moments"" and ""gameplay moments"" , plus the overall experience and story were totally worth it. I hope to see more of this from Daedalic, and totally recommend this title!",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/state-of-mind

I found the gameplay to be extremely fun because racing at high speeds and doing multiple flips always felt rewarding and exhilarating. There’s a decent selection of tracks for you to race on and the variety that’s present in them means things stay fresh and interesting for longer. The inclusion of a four-player split screen is fantastic because it’s very rare nowadays and it does make the game more fun and also give it replayability. I was slightly disappointed with the campaign mode in the game because it’s very basic and nothing much stands out. In terms of content the game doesn’t have a huge amount for you to get to grips with and in my opinion this makes the price of the game too high. Racing is fun for the most part I found the handling to be not as smooth and fluid as I would’ve liked it to be. Back in the day I can remember playing a fantastic little game called Rollcage and it was fantastic because it was unlike any other game I’d played before. Unfortunately there hasn’t really been many game’s since then that have captured that same formula, well that is until now. GRIP: Combat Racing may have a few shortcomings but it offers you an experience that’s very unique compared to most racing game’s out there. It also offers you a fun and at times very exhilarating experience as well and performing various flips always feels rewarding. You can also perform these flips in four-player split screen as well and whilst the handling was a little bit stiff at times it still remained fun when playing this way. Most of the problems the game has are small but for me the game has a big underlying issue and that is that it just doesn’t have enough content to warrant its high asking price. Despite this though GRIP: Combat Racing still does enough to get a solid recommendation from me because even though it’s in a crowded genre it stands out because it is unique in a number of areas and when in full flow your guaranteed to have a lot of fun with the game.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/grip-combat-racing

Sadly, this genre hasn’t seen much love on the newest console generation, outside of a few titles here and there. The newly released Way of the Passive Fist scratches that itch while bringing some new mechanics into the cookie cutter pattern from the past. Where previous offerings have been kind of basic, with a few attacks assigned to face buttons being the bulk of gameplay, this title takes the genre and flips it on its head. This is more akin to a rhythm game, requiring you to parry or dodge enemy attacks to build up a combo meter, and once completed you are able to unleash a devastating single punch that will take down most enemies in a single hit. This is not your only means of offense, as you can push enemies away and once they have become exhausted, simply poke them in the face and they’ll fall over. The game controls well and once you get the timing down, parrying and dodging becomes almost second nature. Similar to the combat in the Arkham series, enemies will display tells above their stamina bar which hints at what action needs to be taken with different colored icons. While the prologue does an excellent job of giving the player the basic knowledge to progress, newer enemy types (which are typically just palette swaps of other characters) do not provide updated instructions, which means relearning patterns and memorizing which colored enemy does what. It does not impact the overall experience much, but it can feel a bit unfair at times. The game features a few modes that you’ll progress through as the mysterious Wanderer, including a standard arcade mode and a story mode featuring 10 chapters which are broken up into smaller chunks. In either mode you can try to earn medals based on your performance, and each area completed will allow you to activate a checkpoint. Sadly, saving mid-chapter is not an option, which poses a bit of a problem as each level is a bit on the longer side compared to similar games. With each chapter taking close to 30 minutes, this is not a game you can sit down and play in small portions. Unlike other beat ‘em ups, there is not a boss on every chapter, but they do come regularly. I found these encounters to be frustrating, as the bosses do not appear to give any of the standard tells that they are attacking. You will be swarmed with minor enemies that are needed to build up your combo meter to unleash the power fist attack on the boss a few times. While these encounters are not overly difficult, they will impede progress for many – even on the easiest settings I had to attempt many of these battles multiple times before moving on. Luckily, death does not carry as much of a penalty as quitting to the main menu mid-mission since you can retry the segments as many times as you wish. This frustration is also present on a number of segments where other mechanics are added, such as bases in the background shooting rockets into the battlefield. While you do receive notification of where they will be landing, the icon is nowhere near as big as the actual area it hits. These came so often it became easier to let them take out the enemies rather than trying to take them down using the Wanderer’s standard tactics. Since this tactic caused my score for the segment to plummet, I am assuming this isn’t what was intended. The overall presentation is beautifully executed, featuring fluid movements and detailed animations that evoke a sense of nostalgia for older gamers familiar with the titles that pushed the older console generations to their limits. Many of the characters appear to be inspired by Mad Max with Asian influences. This also shines through the mid-chapter cut scenes that would fit in with many of the retro titles, only missing the “Don’t do drugs” opening screen that many older games showcased. One feature that I missed which would have improved the overall experience would have been couch or online co-op. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still fun to play, but competing against a friend for a high score or having my son join in on the fun would have elevated the title beyond a good game into remarkable status. The Way of the Passive Fist may disappoint those who like a little more button mashing in their brawler, but it is a unique title that deserves a chance from anyone who wants to relive the glory days and see a more modern take on the genre, even if it’s a solo affair.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/way-of-the-passive-fist

Its a decent concept considering there are better viking games around (Ancestors?). You can equip you warriors with a number of weapons or tokens which enhance their abilities. The game rewards progress. You get better weapons and cards as you advance. The soundtrack is good too and makes you feel like a Viking. What makes the fun limited is that the figurines do not level up and the focus is on the use of buff giving cards in each level. Each level has 3 tiers of difficulty and you are playing the same map over and over again, albeit with altered enemies and increasing difficulty. There is no proper story-line either and there is no difficulty setting except the 3 tiers on each map. It is also a strategy game but does not feel like one because there is little strategic thinking involved. its a decent effort, but not one of the best games out there.

It starts to give more once you start realizing the developers really wanted you to feel on the edge. I ride bikes to commute, on track for fun and even did some club racing, my only critiques is that it seems impossible to get a good start, secondly, there are no practice and qualifying sessions at least not in the early game that I've come across, thirdly the rpm counter on the dash on some of the bikes doesn't rev out or give you indicators for changing gear like you would expect, however the HUD element which cant be positioned in the middle does so your constantly aware of the sound of the bike and the rpm indicator in your peripheral. All in all I recommend spending at least 2 hours playing with the racing line off, helmet view, map off, corner hints off, manual gearing and really start to dial back the rider assists. The game is gonna punish you for making bad mistakes just like the real track and bikes would. Once you get through that you feel exhilarated to a new level. Anyone giving this game less than 5 wanted Ride4 or a MotoGP game, they wanted to be lazy and have the game shower them in gratitude - that ain't gonna happen. Invest get good. this game has a lot to offer. I really did want that race weekend experience though.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/tt-isle-of-man

My memory of playing it then is hazy, and I was not very good at it, but I was no doubt thrilled to be playing a sequel to one of my favorite games ever, to this day. In retrospect I suppose I was quite lucky to do so, as the original release was apparently bug-addled and notoriously demanding of PC hardware of that time. Before Crysis, there was BZ2. This version of BZ2 features heavily updated visuals, in particular very nice lighting effects. It's hard to tell looking at Rebellion's version that the game originally came out in 1999. It also features steam workshop support, much like the earlier Battlezone 98 Redux. Gameplay in Battlezone is simple enough, though it would probably feel odd to today's shooter players. You are controlling a hovering tank with conventional FPS keymaps, with the added element of a simple strategic interface that use the number keys, the mouse and spacebar to select units and structures, and issue orders. If your tank is destroyed, you are not necessarily out of the battle- you automatically eject and can then float down and walk the rest of the way back to your base to obtain a fresh vessel. On foot you are armed with a feeble energy rifle that boasts an alternate sniper mode that can, with precise aim, be used to snipe an enemy pilot out of their vehicle, thus making it available to you. The overall flow feels awkward to me now, but I suspect this system allowed for tight, high-level play in whatever multiplayer scene might have existed once. In addition, where you were limited to only ten units of each category at at time with a finite number of pilots as well, in 2 you can create up to ten groups of ten units each, with no pilot limit, allowing for much larger battles where individual losses are not quite as punishing. Still, it is not hard to see why action-strategy games never fully caught on- in my the experience the average shooter player cannot reasonably be expected to employ anything resembling a strategy. I had an amusing experience playing this version where I accidentally discovered that you can freely fire-link different weapon types using the shift key, and now I'm not certain whether this feature was present in the original release. It certainly might have made my life easier back then. I mentioned earlier that BZ2 is significantly easier then the first game. Part of this is the improved friendly unit AI and command interface, but another major factor is the change in how gathering biometal scrap works. The primary of the game's only two resources, the other being power. In the first game there was a finite amount of scrap on the map at the beginning of a level or match, with additional scrap only appearing from destroyed units or structures. In 2, there are biometal ""pools"" scattered throughout most maps that your scrap harvesters can deploy over, becoming immobile extractors that generate scrap automatically over time. This major change in the underlying economic mechanic of the game put off many players, but makes most campaign missions a matter of simply defending these extractors long enough to build up a sufficient attack force with which to bowl over the enemy base, with the enemy AI only throwing significant attack waves at you in the final few missions. Campaign missions in the first game were severely limited in terms of effective tactical solutions: If you didn't build or move certain things at or to certain locations and times, you were basically screwed, and this is largely not the case in 2 until very late in the campaign. Though it was either streamlined or dumbed-down from the first game, depending on personal interpretation, Battlezone 2 maintained a key aspect of the experience- a combination of emphatic voice acting and written fragments of background information that that told an engrossing story of interstellar discovery, betrayal and intrigue, with a quality soundtrack as well. Whatever the public perception of Battlezone 2 as compared to the first game or otherwise, I consider it a forgotten gem of the late 90s, with a brand of gameplay that has seldom been explored before or since, and I greatly appreciate both these games being made available to a wider audience.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/battlezone-combat-commander

The game's graphics menu does not allow beyond super-sampling (SS) 1.2 (SS is called resolution in the game). Using an oc'ed GTX 1080 the game runs at (usually) 45 fps using SS 1.2, no antialiasing and all other settings maxed (including textures set to Ultra) - and the good old Forceware 385.24 :-) But SS 1.2 is very blurry. Note that the game defaults to SS 1.0 everytime you load a scene or die (even if it still says 1.2 in your settings), needing you to constantly reapply a higher SS value than 1.0. Only lowering resolution increases performance, other settings like LoD, textures and shadows have no effect on frame rate. A GTX 1080 (Ti) is required for 90 fps SS 1.0 - or 45 fps SS 1.1 or 1.2. 45 fps SS 1.6 will probably require a GTX 1180 ;-) There's also a serious error causing the Tray Tool SS value to be multiplied with the in-game SS value. So SS 2.0 (global) in Tray Tool + SS1.2 set in-game resulted in SS 2.4 in-game and totally crashed the game - so beware! I tried to set textures to high instead of ultra and had a hard time seeing any difference. At first textures don't look that good, but when you get close a layer of extremely detailed textures becomes visible - I've never seen more detailed textures, but again - it's only visible when you're a few inches away from the texture. The game is a system hog - much more demanding than for example Lone Echo, Robinson, Doom VFR and Mage's Tale. The ground often looks tesselated - this could explain the extreme hardware requirements. Controls are great, you have options of full locomotion, teleport and more - and there's smooth turning (or angled and more). Your inventory is elaborate reminding me of FallOut 4 VR. Like in Subnautica I needed water and food, and craft items; there are nice light-weight RPG-elements included.

There aren’t many activities in school that allow you to throw things at people with the intent of hitting them without some sort of negative consequences soon following. That means pegging Seth with that big rubber ball brings quite a sense of satisfaction and pride. So what is the best way of translating that to a video game? 1v1 or 2v2 seems to be optimal with the newest game from Fun Punch. It’s worth noting right now that Strikers Edge is a multiplayer game, much like the recent Nidhogg 2. Is there a campaign for the characters? Sure, but it’s more of a training area once you’ve completed the optional tutorial for gameplay. This is made most obvious when seeing almost all of the trophies/achievements are tied to online play. The campaign allows you to view the different stages the game has to offer and find out which character you enjoy playing the most. There are several characters to choose from, each with their own special abilities that will help or hinder your chances of winning, depending on your skills and who the other team is using. This is a game that comes off as simple at a glance, but has a lot of depth. There aren’t many buttons to know – attack, dodge, aim, move, block, and special. Two of those are the analog sticks, which leaves you with four buttons, all of which are shoulder buttons. This makes the most sense as your thumbs will be occupied at all times with moving and aiming. While the computer will likely not give you any issues (depending on the difficulty you choose), much like Smash Bros, your hardest opponents will be humans. And honestly, once you start playing it, you’ll be begging for the challenge. Admittedly, I was drawn to Strikers Edge because of its aesthetic, but it soon had its claws in me with the different play styles associated with each character. Much like a fighting game, you’ll soon find certain characters are better against others, and the varied locales bring different strategies with environmental defenses that break after a certain amount of damage. I can honestly see this becoming a huge game for streaming, and potentially even the e-sport circuit. If you’re playing on the PC, the game also includes a Twitch centered mode, which allows the community to choose what’s going to happen with the match. Certain modifiers are shown prior to it starting, and are then voted on by the community. This makes the game a more interactive experience for viewers, and also adds something new to the game for those playing. The weakest offering here is the campaign. While I appreciate the effort to provide something for those of us that aren’t huge into multiplayer games, it feels like a last minute add-on opposed to a hand crafted experience. There’s some exposition detailing what’s going on with each character, but the meat of it is the battles, and while you’ll go up against more than one opponent at a time, it never provided a sense of accomplishment. Perhaps if there was more of a reason to complete it, I’d have enjoyed it more. I also found myself waiting several minutes at a time for online matches to start up. I believe this has much more to do with the amount of people that had the game and when I was playing it than anything else. While these types of games basically live or die depending on their player base, I believe this will grow quickly once people actually see it in action. Strikers Edge seemingly came out of nowhere, and proves once again that Playdius is a publisher you need to be watching. I believe this is also Fun Punch’s debut title, and what a way to enter the game space. We’ve had a lot of great debuts recently from budding developers, but when genres you normally don’t care for are able to make you crave more from them, that’s something altogether different from the norm. Even if you only plan on playing this locally at parties or small get-togethers, it’ll make a great impression on everyone that picks up a controller and launches a spear.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/strikers-edge

Gravel has come out to change that and thankfully it’s a very good addition to the genre, and despite it suffering with a few shortcomings it ultimately provides you with some brilliant racing. Racing in the game has a true arcade feel, so don’t expect too much realism because they haven’t gone for that approach. The racing on the whole though is very fun and the best thing is that it feels great whilst also offering you a challenge. In terms of vehicles there is a huge amount for you to get to grips with and each vehicle feels considerably different, which is great. There is a decent array of circuits for you to race on and each circuit is packed full of variety which without a doubt keeps things fresh for a lot longer. Gravel offers you a pretty decent career mode and it can be very enjoyable at times, unfortunately though there just isn’t enough of it and that’s basically the biggest problem with this game. There isn’t enough in terms of content as well and if more modes were added I could see myself playing this game for a very long time because everything else has been done extremely well. They do offer you some online multiplayer offerings and this does give the game some much needed replay value. As far as the online multiplayer goes everything holds up really well and I didn’t suffer with any noticeable problems, which is great. Hopefully they keep adding content and make the online multiplayer bigger because that will without a doubt keep the game relevant for a lot longer. The presentation side of the game is something that tickled my fancy quite a lot. Visually the game can look beautiful at times and the effects when going into water have been done very well. The sound design is also pretty decent and it does more than enough to keep you satisfied. At the end of the day Gravel is a game that I’ve been looking forward to for quite a while and thankfully it exceeded my expectations in a way. It may not be perfect and it may be lacking on the content side, but what’s here works well and most important of all it provides you with a true and fun arcade style. Fans of arcade racers will definitely find something they love in Gravel and with me being a fan of arcade racers I appreciate the effort that’s gone into the game and I hope Gravel gets bigger and bigger.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/gravel

Set in a drug-fuelled, retrofuturistic city in an alternative 1960s England, youll have to blend in with its other inhabitants, who dont take kindly to people who dont abide by their not-so-normal rules. ***1960s Dystopian England***Set in a retrofuturistic 1960s, you will find a city ravaged by war and rebuilt by delusionally happy people. Everything appears to be happy in Wellington Wells, including the roads, the people, and its omnipresent television personality, Uncle Jack! However, its a beautiful world on the brink of collapse. You will discover the history of this world, and how it came to be just so beguilingly happy. ***Suspicion and Joy***We Happy Few is about surviving in and escaping from a procedurally generated world, where you must learn to hide in plain sight. If you act out of turn, or youre not on Joy (the local happy pills), the locals will become suspicious and will rapidly turn your frown upside down! Forcefully. You will need to practice conformity, stealth and combat if you want to survive long enough to escape. ***A Mature Story***We Happy Fews characters are not typical video game heroes. They are flawed and not particularly heroic, warped by the trauma their world has been through. Each character has their own storyline that reacts to the events of the world around them, and their place within it. Our stories are definitely not appropriate for children, but are laced with dark humour, hope, and even a spot of redemption. ***Features***In We Happy Few, you will experience:- A procedurally generated world, meaning that everyones experience will be unique,- A range of difficulties for new and experienced players alike, - Permadeath, if you want to satisfy all your masochistic needs,- Three modes: sandbox, story and Wellie mode,- A unique soundtrack, and- A fully voiced, cinematic, first person story. And you can play it in your own style:- Fill your basic needs (hunger, thirst, and sleep) to survive,- Learn how to interact with the other members of your society, and choose stealth, conformity or combat,- Encounter dozens of in-game unique events,- Conform to the specific local habits by learning to behave accordingly, and taking your Joy,- Collect recipes, scavenge items and craft dozens of weapons, tools and devices,fight with your bare hands or the crazy weapons you create,watch out for traps, or learn how to use them to your advantage.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/we-happy-few

The music was excellent and gave me a relaxing vibe that complemented the puzzles so well.  I liked that they tried to add a narrative and also break up the monotony of doing puzzles by adding the hotel aspect and some mystery, but it felt lacking.  The concept was good but needed to be more fleshed out.  By the end, I still didn't really know what happened and the ending felt lackluster.

It is a team game that rewards knowledge and cooperation. Some will find the gameplay tedious, and I can understand why. But to those who give it a chance, the real joy of the game is knowing your role, working seamlessly with your team, and blowing enemy airships out of the sky. Performance wise, this PS4 port is not great. It seems strange that a game over 5 years old cannot run at a consistent 60fps on console. Even with crossplay with PC, the player counts are fairly low.

Its easy to learn but has quite a bit of nuance to master. For anyone who is new to the series its like an on rails physics puzzler with dirt bikes and stunts. Almost gives me a bit of a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater feeling. I love the laid back music and theme of the game. The locations are beautiful and look great on the Switch screen and on the big screen. Playground for Switch is a great pick up and play game at a fair price. Perfect when you only have 1-15 minutes to spare or if you want to spend hours trying to unlock everything. It really fits right at home on the Switch. My main gripe about the game is that I wish I could restart a level without having to wait for load again. When respawning after a crash the game is very fast but if you want to restart even before you've hit the first checkpoint you have to wait a bit. The loads are fast so its a very small gripe. I also wish there were more unlockables but maybe there will be more after I beat it.  If you are considering buying the game I would just go for it or wait for a sale. It's already really cheap on the eshop and I think almost any gamer could enjoy it. I hope they bring more to the Switch with even more levels and customization.

Rad Rodgers is a platformer that does this and whilst it has a few shortcomings I ended up having a hell of a time with the game for the most part. There are a few different mechanics in play at the same time in this game and they’ve done a very good job here. Platforming feels very smooth and the shooting elements provide you with quite a few enjoyable moments. I would however have liked the weapon upgrades to feel like they mattered more, but unfortunately I never felt any more powerful when I collected these. The controls which are obviously the most important thing in a game like this thankfully remained tight and responsive throughout and I never suffered with any problems here, which is great. The level design in the game is something that tickled my fancy quite a bit and whilst the levels can be a little on the long side I found exploring them to be extremely fun and there are plenty of secrets littered throughout, which in turn keeps things fresh. There are a few enemies you have to battle in the game and some of them are not too bad, but I just thought the enemies were missing something. They just feel a little generic and nothing much stands out with them, which is a shame. Something that does stand out in the game is the humour that’s present. This game had me chuckling to myself a number of times, but I must admit that they can go a bit too far at times. The presentation side of the game is without a doubt one of my favourite parts about the game. Visually the game is very crisp looking and packed full of colour and the most impressive part is that it looks retro and modern at the same time. The sound design has also been very well done and it does a great job of enhancing the gameplay at times. At the end of the day Rad Rodgers is a game that’s right up my alley and if you’re a fan of platformers that have a naughty side to them then you will really enjoy this game. Don’t get me wrong there are better games in the genre but Rad Rodgers has charm in abundance and for that reason it gets a thumbs up from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/rad-rodgers

I quickly got tires of reading through the dialog and caring what was going on...but the level design and environmental story telling here is great...This is a bit of a fetch quest meets rpg brawler game..You go around different class rooms to collect items, both for main quests as well as side quests you’ll collect along your way and by collecting items and completing quests you’ll be rewarded with text books, experience and items...Text books can be traded in o unlock new moves for combat, all of which are tied to an action button and run on a cool down.. More are unlocked as you progress the game and you can level them up with unused textbooks as well as its own currency earned from enemies and quests.I got a very heavy stick of truth feel from this game, I was laughing at random spots the whole way thanks to the number of real life historical figures and references throughout the game.You can put on different items as long as they’re not too high of a level to increase your stats like an rpg, these items can be again obtained by completing quests, but are also dropped by enemies and can be purchased in store with the cash you collect as you play the game..Certain enemies drop certain materials though, which is what makes this fetch quest game so fun...you know what you have to get, and you have to remember which enemy drops that items and go farm them to get a certain amount of that item and turn it in, however the farming is more tied to side quests..Main quests are usually objective based of go to this person, or clear this room, go obtain this item, give it to another character that will give you the item you came to class for...these classrooms though aren’t just regular rooms.. They are all brought to life and feel unique from each other...This game took me well over 20 hours to complete, and not once did I feel bored...new enemies are constantly being introduced and new places give you higher level enemies so it never starts to feel easy..However I do feel this game over stays its welcome quite a bit... it says a lot that it took about 15 hours for me to be over it... but that feeling of will this please just end definitely came.. There is such thing as too much of a good thing, and this is an example, of that Each area does end in a challenging boss fight though, all of which feel fair and satisfying to complete, with maybe one or 2 a bit too easy…The most challenging aspect of this game though comes down to its lack of an auto save... to save the game you have to enter a restroom and quick save or manual save... this will refill your health…these rest areas aren’t that frequently though..  You could constantly run back and save after making tons of quest progress, but it just feels inconvenient having to do so...I would’ve preferred more of a checkpoint system here. .is I lost easily hours of progress to dying to random enemies on my way back from an area I just got a key item for...My biggest complaint with this game is how vague mission indicators are... an exclamation on a door to the target location would’ve been nice here as id occasionally be running around the school not sure where to get an item or get to a location the game told me to get toOverall though I really enjoyed my time with Super Daryl Deluxe, is one of those great indie games that deserves your attention..It has its flaws with progression delivery, but the world here is charming and magic.This is an addictive and challenging experience worth picking up.I give Super Daryl Deluxean 8/10",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/super-daryl-deluxe

On the one hand, there's the story, which can basically be summed up in two words: Kotaro Uchikoshi. It's got all his classic strengths: creative use of time travel and metafiction, mysteries and bangs that keep the plot driving forward, and distinct characters - and unlike many of his games, it has an actual proper ending. Unfortunately, it also has many of his classic weaknesses: too many conveniently outlandish characters in too small a physical and narrative space and a massively confused scale, characters not acting their age, some moments with very awkward pacing, and some tremendous contrivances (such as a major military battle in which apparently no-one was badly hurt). It's the kind of story that's great to go through once, but it's probably not going to be that memorable. And let's be clear - this is all about the story. This is a visual novel, not a puzzle game. Yes, there's sections where you try to manipulate objects in order to play ""tricks"" to get events you want to happen, but the number of choices of object is quite small and inconsistent and the consequences are too unpredictable to really be tactical. Yes, it can be hilarious to see how your actions domino through to affect the characters, but that's a double edged sword - in order to be hilarious, it has to be unpredictable, which means you're just guessing at what to do in most of the scenarios. It's also weirdly stop/start - when you click on an item to manipulate, you have to wait while the screen fades to black and white, the object moves, it pauses, the screen fades back in, you see the reaction, and then the screen whites out completely with a ""cleanup in progress"" sign because they couldn't be bothered to animate the character recovering from being tricked. It's irritating and breaks any immersion the game was going for. In fact, about three-quarters of the way through the game it drops the ""trick"" part entirely and becomes a traditional VN with binary choices, most of which lead have one option to continue and one that is instant death. What's worse, they often don't make sense. For example, the very first choice you get is when a character asks you to do something that makes perfect sense at the time, but if you say you'll do it, you get an instant ending saying that you ultimately failed to achieve a key goal as a result of being too dependent on them. Which is ridiculous because a) you've been depending on them the whole game up to that point, and b) when you make the correct choice, you find that all they were going to do is tell you they aren't going to give you orders and leave! And then there is the elephant in the room. Panties. The weird thing is that they aren't needed in the game, or plot, at all. There's never like a critical moment when they matter, and the only influence they have on the game is that if they come into view during the trick segments the controls go wobbly and you have to pan away from them before a timer runs out (or just press a single button to change the camera position to a different one, which makes it trivial, and also makes you notice that there are camera positions which exist only to upskirt the female characters). You might be looking at panties (on a cartoon 3D model) like 3-4 seconds, if you play badly - so if you actually want to do that, it won't be satisfying, and if you just find the whole thing a bit creepy like I did, it's just unnecessarily so. Yet the game mentions them all the time, the loading screen shows a girl with her skirt riding up, there's a ""gallery"" of viewed panty shots, one of the chapters is called ""panty party"" (which does not contain any panties nor even mention them) etc.. It just comes across as unnecessarily creepy, and has the feeling of having been glued onto the game because of the popularity of salacious VNs in some markets and/or because of the tie-in with an existing anime (although the anime just treated it as an occasionally-mentioned joke). There's also some QoL problems. The game doesn't tell you a whole bunch of useful things, such as that you can skip videos by holding down X (which you will want to do, because the game plays an identical anime opening and closing sequence for every one of the 20 chapters) or that you can save at any time (which you will also want to do, because the instant deaths in part 2 otherwise require you to play the entire chapter from the beginning, and one of them is right at the end of a chapter!) So if you can get this as a sale price and you don't mind the visual novel gameplay and narrative style, and can tolerate the unnecessary creepage, it's probably worth a punt, especially if you're an Uchikoshi fan and are frustrated by his endings (since this has one of the most satisfactory endings of any Uchikoshi game). But it's generally too weak to be a global recommendation, and certainly not worth full price.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/punch-line

However it improved the gameplay formula with some great additions. The mixture of this made a challenging gameplay with lot of hard decision. Also the art style, soundtrack and graphics are excellent and enhance the immersion. I must admit that many say and criticize that it is nearly a 1 on 1 copy of Banner Saga or even outright plagiarism but I say this is a good thing as the Banner Saga is truly excellent and the game has its merits. The story of the game is written by Russian author Sergey Malitsky. I did not know him before but this awakened my interest for his works. It is presented like a visual story and you have to make decisions that can have anything from minor to critical results. It is set in a world named Terminus which has medieval technology and magic exist but not in large amounts. After a flashback several hundreds years ago where a group of immortal warriors stopped an apocalyptic event called “The Reaping” by sacrificing themselves the story starts. It focus on the travel of three groups as a new apocalyptic event seems to start (I am vague to avoid spoilers). There is the retired guard captain Thorn Brenin and his daughter who are forced into a journey, then there is the healer / scholar Hopper Rouley who is more than it seems and finally the assassin Lo Pheng who is a member of an ancient order. Those 3 and their allies will be deciding the fates of the world if they survive. The story has branches and it is not granted that all characters will reach the final. The story is well written and interesting. I was invested into the characters, lore and world. I must remark that you will not get all answers immediately as the characters themselves do not know the reasons behind the events. At the end you will have answers but also other questions (Set up for a sequel and other motives existing as well). My only critique here is the translation (German version) which is not good. The English version is better. Gameplay: You travel on routes you can chose to your destination. Depending on them there are events, battles, decisions and other things. I like to have more options than in Banner Saga and it feels good. A key element are gems called Strixes. These protect you and you should avoid to run out of them. This can lead to some hard decisions. The events, choices and different routes are to my fullest liking and improved this in comparison to Banner Saga. The battles are turn based and require strategy. Each side has alternating turns no mater the numbers but you can chose the order. Example you have 6 characters so after 12 turns you have used every character once. Like I said the order depends on you as you cant use a character again before all of your others have acted in this turn too and ended the round. This is dangerous when you have spared the most powerful enemies until the end. Each character has abilities you can use. There is a resource called energy that is mandatory for some abilities but also can be used for extended movements. You gain experience through battles and can learn and improve abilities. There are some interesting options and character variety. Don't expect to completely change a characters role. There are magic cards you can use. The better the later you can use them as there are minimum rounds for activation. Those can be won or bought and mostly are in multiple parts you have to collect. Some are pretty useful. I nearly forgot that downed characters in battle are injured and have lowered stats. I costs time to recover and Strixes. There is more like items, moral and loyality but you will get used to this. Like I said there are branches including multiple endings and you can fail in small and big situations. Some decisions are better than others. Presentation wise the game is excellent. The art style is amazing and the graphics enjoyable. The visual novel style works really well. The soundtrack was even better. It impressed me multiple times during my playthrough. There are some negatives: The already mentioned poor translation (German version only), the story could be told a bit better (reveals faster done)  and a few bugs I encounter like minor control problems. Overall this was still a 10/10 for me. I liked the Banner Saga and this is pretty much a carbon copy. The characters, lore and gameplay won me over.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/ash-of-gods-redemption

Thankfully I Hate Running Backwards provided me with a lot of enjoyable moments, and even though it has a few shortcomings I still find it to be a decent addition to the Shoot-‘Em-Up genre. One of the most important things in a game like this is for them to have responsive controls and thankfully this game has just that. The controls remain fluid at all times and most important of all there simple and responsive, which means you can focus on the fun gameplay without worrying that the controls will let you down. Speaking about the gameplay to say I had fun would be a massive understatement, and the best thing is that no game ever plays out the same way so there is some replaybility present. You will however have to get used to the difficulty curve in the game because at the start it can be a little too difficult so expect to get frustrated every now and then. As you progress though you will notice that you get better and better and that’s mainly down to the very good unlockables you get along the way. Without a doubt each unlockable improves you considerably and it was very fun trying out each weapon because each weapon has a lot of variety going for it. The game also boasts a lot of variety when it comes to the enemies you face and destroying them feels very satisfying, which is a bonus. I will say though that the game is best enjoyed in short bursts because even though it does have variety in a few areas the gameplay is basically the same throughout. This isn’t a problem when playing with a friend but when you play on your own after a short while things can become a little tedious. You will also notice a few technichal issues during your time with the game as well, but thankfully the developers are releasing a patch and none of the issues are anything major so you can easily look past them. The presentation side of the game may not be to everybody’s liking, but I really enjoyed it and I think the visuals and sound design combined together really well and in a way they gave the game a little bit of uniqueness. At the end of the day I Hate Running Backwards may not be the best Shoot-‘Em-Up out there but it does what it sets out to do extremely well and that is provide you with fun and frantic action. Without a doubt this is a game I can see myself returning to time and time again and it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/i-hate-running-backwards

Theres not much going on in this world at all..Until you finally open the gate to move on.. this is when you have to take down that levels boss…Each one feeling completely different from the last and are some of this games best moments…They break up the pacing of item collecting and enemy slaying and putting your combat and item timing to the test… The boss battles here are thankfully more fun than difficult and feel just as big and as important as the main levels themselves.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/mulaka

El título tiene muchísimo que entregar y puede transformarse en horas y horas de juego. El sistema de combate por turnos comienza siendo bastante simple, pero en la medida que avanza la historia se va tornando mucho más estratégico, con una amplia variedad de personajes, modos de batallar, técnicas e ítemes para utilizar.La gráficos son sencillamente preciosos. El diseño de personajes es único, así como los vestuarios estrafalarios que usan las alquimistas. Los escenarios tienen muchos detalles y te envuelven en una atmósfera mágica.La música y sonidos son excelentes. Hay muchas melodías que sonarás por varios días en la cabeza antes de poder olvidarlas y se adaptan muy bien a cada escenario.La historia no es muy fantástica, está orientada más bien a la cotidianidad de los personajes. Hay muchísimas escenas que se activarán al visitar distintos lugares donde podremos conocer distintos personajes y su relación entre sí. Los diálogos son bastante graciosos y los personajes hablan y se mueven de manera que parecieran expresar las emociones que transmiten sus palabras.Sin embargo, lo mejor del juego es el sistema de creación de ítemes, llamado ""alquimia"". Al prinicipio  podrá confundir a los jugadores que no están familiarizados con la saga Atelier, pero dándole varias horas se termina comprendiendo y en ese momento llega la adicción de crear los ítemes más perfectos y con mejores características. Se puede estar horas frente al caldero combinando materiales para crear una infinidad de ítemes cuya receta vamos descubriendo de distintas maneras a través del juego.Personalmente, Atelier Lydie & Suelle me encantó, es el juego al cual más horas le he dedicado (alrededor de 110) y lo recomiendo fuertemente a los fans de los JRPG y a quienes les gusten los juegos de creación como Dragon Quest Builders, My Time At Portia o Dofus.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/atelier-lydie-suelle-the-alchemists-and-the-mysterious-paintings

How did he get here? What/Where is here? Did he leave the coffee pot on? Most of these are questions that, to be quite honest, you’ll have to draw your own conclusions for. The game does not hold your hand, mechanically or in reference to the narrative, requiring you to fill in the blanks. A brief tutorial will give you some minor hints as to the fact that Jim can control time – not in the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time kind of way, but more like just changing the time from day to night and vice versa. I know, this sounds like a lame power, right? Well, Jim uses this ability to essentially control or manipulate the otherworldly flora and fauna to his advantage. Can’t find a way forward? You’ll probably need to change the time of day, forcing freakishly large mushrooms to form a pathway, or psychedelic flowers to bloom giving Jim super speed for a short period of time, allowing him to gain momentum for a long jump. This ability is really easy to use and is explained quite early into the game, but is used so infrequently during the first half of the game that I actually forgot it was even a thing and that it was limited to pressure pads. The first half of the game is primarily focused on stealth and platforming with some light puzzle solving, while the second half makes use of the time alteration. You’ll spend the early hours evading robots that are also visiting the planet, but seem to be dead set on destroying each and every last living creature. There are also plenty of animals and in some cases plants that think Jim looks like a tasty snack, so be weary of those as well. The enemy forces are quite varied, requiring you to often think outside of the box to either evade, distract, or destroy the well-designed bad guys who come equipped with a better than most AI presence. There is a single weak link in this area, and that is the gigantic hornet who looks like he ate the meth, meth lab, cook, and RV in one swoop. While meth-hornet normally sleeps all day, as meth addicts tend to do, they will often ignore their own instincts (or game mechanics), requiring you to either run head first into death just to respawn, or sit there patiently changing the time from day to night, hoping they break free of whatever trance they are in. In addition to this, their sting can’t seem to decide if it wants to be lethal or not, often allowing you to be stung three or more times and still make a clean getaway, whereas others a single prick is the end. I know, I know, “the suspension of disbelief” and “it’s just a game;” I am all for imagination time, but if you’re going to make the game’s rules, I need you to stick by them. The sneaking and platforming mechanics work extremely well, with the jumps often feeling overly forgiving when compared to similar games. The controls are precise yet accessible and the puzzles are intuitive, using simple common sense or physics in most cases, with the only point of frustration stemming from a few segments later into the game that require you to use momentum to make some extremely long jumps, requiring extremely careful planning before you can even see them coming. I found myself dying repeatedly in these areas, requiring me to take notes or even memorize the pattern to progress. Death is merely an afterthought in the world of Planet Alpha, with frequent checkpoints being the norm. The checkpoints come so often (it feels like you receive one every time your feet hit the ground) I found myself jumping off into the nothingness below in an effort to find secrets tucked away within the beautiful levels. The stealth gameplay functions beautifully, with most of the enemies providing visual or audible tells that they are searching for you, patrolling the grounds as a normal guard would. High grass is plentiful, allowing Jim regular points to hide in. Functionally, sneaking is well executed, but a nagging glitch I encountered saw this tall grass randomly jerking and twisting about as I moved between cover, not flowing as it normally would (or does during most of the game) and breaking what would otherwise be a very immersive experience. Planet Alpha, Team17’s 100th release since inception, is an amazing visual treat, offering outstanding gameplay that is just shy of perfection due to its underwhelming conclusion. When I started playing the game, my initial thoughts were that this is just a prettier version of Limbo. After taking in the entire picture, this is the game that Playdead should be taking note of when making their next release. Meanwhile, I will sit back in anticipation for what Planet Alpha ApS brings us next.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/planet-alpha

I like how you can mold this character that comes to life in the cinematics and story. Your ‘avatar’ grows as you play, learning skills and being able to play different classes. In campaign, the survival part is realistic where you have to hunt for food and gather water, otherwise you can start losing health and stamina and eventually die. It has a Breath or the Wild feel in those mechanics. You gather parts all over and build up your base as you see fit to defend yourself from different types of infected mutants. There are daily, weekly and monthly challenges that net you different resources for unlocking content so you can log in daily for a short time and still progress.  I’m playing on the Xbox One X and the HDR and enhancements look great on the screen, I hope MGS5 Phantom Pain gets similar enhancements in a patch. If you see it for what it is, I think you will enjoy what the developers have created here. This is not meant to be an important entry in the Metal Gear series, but instead a way to have fun with the world and mechanics in a different way and in that it succeeds. It’s also priced fairly for what it is. The only gripe I have so far is if you want to create a new avatar, you have to either delete your first one, log in as a different account, or buy a character slot for coins which I think (not sure) are only available via real money. I will update the review after I spend more time with it and get to play the online.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/metal-gear-survive

Does Hero Defense do enough to get a recommendation from me? All in all game’s that feature different mechanics or genre’s at the same time often fail because they just give themselves too much to do. That being said when a game gets the different mechanics spot on then you have a very enjoyable time and it often makes that said game stand out quite considerably. Hero Defense thankfully is a game that does get the different mechanics they’ve implemented spot on and if it didn’t suffer with the shortcomings it has you’d be talking about a game that’s up there with the very best in terms of strategy and RPG. Thankfully though despite its little imperfections it still gets more right than it gets wrong and in the end I was able to look past its shortcomings thanks to its fun and addictive gameplay. In the end then this fun and addictive gameplay makes recommending the game to you a no-brainer and if you’re a fan of RPG and strategy elements you can do far worse than Hero Defense.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/hero-defense

The presentation side of the game surprised me quite a bit because I didn’t expect there to be as much detail as there was in both the visuals and sound design. The story was minimalistic while in some areas I actually found what were available to me to be very well written and ultimately interesting. Strategy plays a big part in this game and I was pleased with how intricate certain strategy elements were. Unfortunately the game lacks in several areas when it comes to variety and this does mean that the game does get repetitive rather quickly. You can’t really explore in the game which means the levels feel a little underdeveloped. I found the RPG aspects to be a little basic and there wasn’t much that stood out here and what it did have has been seen many times before. The World War II and Nazi setting has been done a lot in recent times but for some reason the historian in me comes rushing to the surface and I always look forward to a game that features these settings. Achtung! Cthulhu Tactics features this setting but it puts a bit of a unique spin on things, and whilst it isn’t perfect it does get more things right than it gets wrong. One of the main things this game gets right is definitely the combat because there’s quite a lot of depth present and this does make the combat rewarding in pretty much all areas. Obviously the combat wouldn’t be as good if it didn’t feature a decent strategic side to things and thankfully I’m pleased to say that they’ve got the strategy elements spot on. In terms of problems the game has a few underlying issues and for me the biggest problem was that it lacked in terms of variety. There’s several areas where this game doesn’t have much in terms of variety and when you combine that with the lack of exploration available to you things can start to get repetetive quite quickly. Despite this though Achtung!

It contains almost every Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors character. The samurai characters have their full hyper-attack which gives them a big advantage in mobility and power, especially as you start adding elements to your weapons. Unlike Dynasty Warriors, there is no weapon switching so if you don't like Daqiao's twin rods you won't even want to play as her. The new characters are a decent addition but all play like Dynasty Warriors characters and so fail to measure up to the samurai. The story is fair, but with such a large cast nobody really gets a chance to shine. Note that while you can customize your weapons with elements, you have to find the powerful 'gold' ones and weapon fusion is gone. All characters' musou attacks have been shortened and weakened, and the samurai lose the window of invincible action they got in previous games. The addition of magic attacks alleviates this somewhat, but feels incomplete. If you haven't played the other games in the series you won't mind, but if you have you will regret the number of small things that are no longer there. I played it until beating every mission and unlocking every character, but went back to playing Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate because that game felt like it had better staying power. This is a good action game, but other games do most aspects better and the story fails to measure up to Orochi 3. It plays fine on the Switch, but gamers with a PS4 will want to buy it on that because frame-rate is higher, the computer spawns more and slightly more aggressive enemies.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/warriors-orochi-4

Почему? На мой взгляд очень сбалансированная и неперегруженая игра получилась. В игре добавили чуть не главный параметр жажды, который требует всё время искать воду, соответственно заставляет не отсиживаться на месте, двигаться постоянно вперёд. Убрали из игры максимально всё лишнее.

С удовольствем перепроходим игру уровни по несколько раз, добиваясь максимально крутого результата. Наконец-то в игре увидел явно выраженные недостатки героев, не недопрокаченные  параметры, а именно минусы.Кол-во героев сокращено с той-же целью, есть какой-то набор перков, которым хочешь проходить, выбираешь соответствующих желаемым перкам героев и вперёд. Потрясающяя идея с ещё одним параметром - адреналин, который весьма гармонично раскрывается в боях, позволяя расширять тактику отряда специфическими возможностями. Неплохая реализация ""удачи"", несколько раз заходя на локацию с врагами получаешь разные шансы попасть во врагов, враги могут по разному контратаковать, в разных вариантах враги выискивают наёмников. Здесь же шанс получить нужную или не очень нашлёпку к оружию или броне. Хотя если не хочешь полагаться на случай, проблемы решает SaveLoad. Чем больше играем, тем больше затягивает.Считаю, что текущая вариация J/A сильно недооценена и достойна более высокого среднего балла.

Like sport based games such as FIFA (for football) or others, it certainly can be worth it if you enjoy cycling and love the whole racing experience, however if you are a typical gamer, it most likely isn't worth it. With that said, I am going to focus on this game from the perspective of a person who would have an interest in the sport and therefore more likely the game. Since Cyanide and Focus studios first launched the series of games in 2011, there certainly have been large improvements to the overall game play, graphics, and much more. This years version features not only the Tour itself, but a number of other famous races, from the Criterium du Dauphine, to the cobbled classics of Paris-Roubaix, and even more. One thing the game misses out on is the other grand tours (the tours of Italy and Spain) however there is plenty to do. Besides the addition of the roubaix classic, there are only a few additions (namely a pro rider mode, in which you control a new rider, a new fitness peak system, and a slightly larger season of events.) So, although there are some new things to the game, much like FIFA, there isn't really much of a difference between the 2017 and 18 versions. The graphics of the game could do with improvement, but altogether it looks reasonably smooth. Gameplay is exciting when there is action, and long uneventful parts of the stage can be skipped. The team comm is now even more advanced, with you now able to disable rider's AIs, however they still seem to lack in response to commands, and it can be frustrating trying to bring them up through the peloton! Overall I think cyanide have done a good job of the came. It captures well the drama and intensity of the biggest moments of the tour, with riders met by crowds of cheering people (which eerily slide across the road) and a mix of intense time trials, explosive sprints, and GC battles. My only concern for this game is that, apart from a few new game features, a new tour route and slight changes to certain areas of the game, it is very similar to the 2017 version, which is why I would rate it an 8. To get a 10, I would expect much bigger advances in the game in some areas, however I will cut some slack, because you can only add so much before there's nothing left to add. So settle into the saddle - its a long ride from the Grand-Depart!",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/tour-de-france-2018

Unfortunately though the game has too many problems and whilst it does have quite a few good points as well it never reaches its full potential because certain issues hold it back quite considerably. When it comes to the combat though I think they get this aspect of the game spot on. The enemies that you come across have lots of variety going for them and tackling them can be a huge amount of fun. I think the main reason why tackling enemies was fun is because the combat elements in the game feel like they pack a punch and because of this taking down an enemy can be extremely satisfying. Unfortunately the world in which the combat takes place is a little on the bland side and in my opinion it just doesn’t feel alive and that does make exploring a little boring. Another reason why the world doesn’t come alive is because the missions that are present in the world are very repetetive and they grow stale quite quickly which means tackling them can feel like a chore a lot of the time. Thankfully though the missions do have a decent story that accompany them and this did make me want to carry on with them but it didn’t hide all of the problems. The most annoying problems that persist are the technichal issues the game suffers with and these issues never seem to go away. They try to keep the frustration levels down by offering a decent difficulty curve but you forget about this quite quickly because the technichal side of the game just annoys you and that’s all you remember in the end, which is a shame. The presentation side of the game disappointed me a great deal and to say I wanted more from it would be a massive understatement. The visuals and sound design just lacked the wow factor and everything about this aspect of the game just felt dated, which in turn harmed the immersion levels somewhat. At the end of the day I can see quite a lot of people being quite disappointed with Extinction and I understand why because a game that is priced quite excessively shouldn’t have as many problems as it does. Don’t get me wrong it’s not the worst game I’ve ever played before and it does provide you with some very enjoyable moments at times, but these enjoyable moments are often littered with technichal issues and these issues harm the fun factor quite a lot. Unfortunately I can’t fully recommend Extinction to you at this time and I would definitely recommend that you wait until it lowers in price before getting it.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/extinction

The studio is currently headed up by Adam Boyes, with a pedigree of both Capcom and Sony Interactive Entertainment. And for anyone that loves memes in the game space, they’ll likely recognize Dave Lang as well, who was the star of the studio up until recently. Lovers of Kinda Funny may have seen him with the boys showcasing Videoball a couple years ago. Knowing that they have some experience in the fighting genre, it’s no wonder that Extinction looks to take an action game and create a battle system that has mechanics which includes cancels. To put it more clearly, think of God of War‘s battle system but with even more emphasis on combos. Progressing through the game you’ll be able to upgrade your abilities, one of which includes being able to attack while dodging, meaning a whole world of new attacks. Interestingly, a good majority of the game doesn’t necessarily require you to use any of these systems, as they are only effective against the smaller enemies that you’ll face off against. I spent a good amount of my time avoiding these altogether as they were often a waste of time in the grand scheme of things. Going into this I was under the impression that it was going to be an open world game, along the lines of Darksiders. Turns out this is actually a level-based game with specific goals for each mission, with an assortment of optional medals to be acquired each playthrough, including completion within a set amount of time, defeating a certain amount of enemies, or defeating the Ravenii under certain circumstances. The more medals acquired means more points able to use for ability unlocks. Some levels will even have randomly generated goals, making the experience a bit different each time you play. For those that get stuck in the game, you’re able to replay levels to acquire more experience for abilities. For the first half of the game, I spent the majority of my time saving citizens by charging crystals they surround and killing Ravenii. Without sped up charging, this is where you’ll spend a lot of your time utilizing combos. However, the more time spent killing the small fries means more time for the Ravenii to destroy the city, and if the city health gets too low, it’s game over. In my time with it, I was able to save the citizens before they were killed which not only meant more experience for abilities, but a large increase in your kill gauge for the Ravenii. In order to kill one of the gargantuan ogres you need to have a full gauge to slice off the beasts’ heads. Other ways to boost the gauge include killing the smaller enemies, although I spent most of my time attacking the armor and limbs of the formidable foes. This was both efficient in keeping the giants from destroying the city while also preparing the creatures for their death. Movement throughout the game is smooth, with the ability of jumping up buildings and walls, as well as bounding through the canopies of trees. It’s when climbing the Ravenii that you will find frustration though, as well as when the game forces you to jump out of the range of the crystals from which the citizens were saved, as I found myself stuck within an invisible force field more often than no. It’s a shame that games that task the player with scaling large enemies means some sort of disenchantment. Oure is the latest game to cause grief in this respect, although I found my fair share of it playing Shadow of the Colossus on the PS2, and a boss near the end of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow. In addition to the main story, the game offers a couple other modes. For lovers of daily challenges, you’re able to compete against others with different goals each day. Of course, it’s in your best interest to prolong these as long as possible to boost your score. There’s also an option that allows you to play as long as you can without dying, which is the game’s namesake. Probably the most unique aspect is the time trial, which tasks you with running through a course of sorts charging crystals. Instead of fighting, this focuses on movement through the game, which is a breath of fresh air to the rest of the experience. With an assortment of missions and enemies as the game progress, forcing you to change tactics, there’s a decent amount to dig into here. Regrettably, playing missions back to back can become a bit dull, as the missions themselves don’t differ much in gameplay. Whether you’re saving civilians, defending watch towers for a certain period of time, or killing a set amount of Ravenii, the gameplay loop never really changes. The story itself is also a bit lacking and didn’t do much to keep my attention.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/extinction

Seeing the name Good Shepherd excited me though, as the last game from them I played was absolutely fantastic. Of course, the same publisher doesn’t always mean similar quality; likewise, developers are entirely capable of making something completely different from their previous IPs. But I like to be optimistic in these cases, especially when it comes to indie games. Of course, 1970s pulp fiction is much different from 1920s America focused on fictional and non-fictional stories. The opening of this game surprised me, as I really didn’t expect the direction it would take. It was an interesting choice for introducing the main character, and certainly one I won’t forget for a while. In a post-Hotline Miami world, hyper violence in a top down world is normalized in games. At first I thought that’s what we’d be getting with this, but it turned out to have a lot more to offer than busting into rooms and close quarter situations. The first level has you heading to a motel of sorts, choking guys out and getting information. Soon after you bust into the designated room and your first gun fight takes place. Following this you will use gun-play quite a bit, and will even lead to you in a car pursuit shooting enemies while driving and dodging obstacles. It ends with a boss battle utilizing all the mechanics the game has taught you up to this point, and is fairly straightforward. The game offers a normal difficulty and it only goes up from there. If you feel the game is too hard, this is the type that requires you to “git gud.” It’s not overly challenging, as the most difficult sections are usually because of a hidden enemy that ambushes you, or because you make a stupid mistake. Unlike the titular Hotline Miami and an assortment of games that followed in its footsteps, death does not come as quickly as a single hit. Far from it as your life is much more reminiscent of the games that did away with health bars and allowed you to regenerate your health by avoiding damage for a few seconds. The choices used for this game make for a unique experience, although at times things seem a bit too drawn out. The difficulty has always made these types of games more strategy based than anything, with fairly short levels that could easily be sketched on a small piece of paper. The ideas for many of the levels in this could be done in the same manner, although they seem to be extended much longer, making them feel padded for length. There are an assortment of enemies that you’ll come across while traversing the levels, each of which have guns, knives, and more, oh my. Admittedly, the AI isn’t all that intelligent, as melee enemies will often times walk up to the environmental object you’re hiding behind allowing you to shoot them. Maneuvering the zones will often mean rolling around to avoid arousing any suspicion. Using cover is vital to survival, although objects used for cover are able to be destroyed. The game offers you the option to play through portions stealthily, but unless it’s specifically supposed to be played in that manner, chances are you won’t get far that way. Similarly to the first Uncharted, the melee option lasts for one or two guys, but soon becomes a fire fight. It’s far from A Thief’s End, which allowed you to clear areas out entirely with stealth. In addition to the different weapons you’ll come across, you’ll be able to utilize the environment for attacks as well. It’s nice to see a game that is not afraid to do something different, especially with a genre that has more or less provided everything I thought we’d see from it. From the way the levels are depicted and how the story plays out to the battles themselves, the game is a fun romp through the 70s in a tale for revenge. While parts of it seem to drag out a bit too long, the game is undeniably fun and worth checking out.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/milanoir

The only other good option is Fishing Planet, but personally I find its controls, UI and monetization system to be unbearable. Bear in mind this is not a hardcore sim, and adopts many ""arcade-like"" qualities along with its simulation elements. FSW has excellent fish AI (fish traverse the lake following food sources, temperature affects behavior, etc.) and good controls, but it's lacking in other ways: lure action mechanics are a good idea but inconsistent and finicky for some methods, and so are the different ways the game handles tackle/fish interactions, such as smaller fish breaking heavy duty line, fish taking lures they normally wouldn't irl, etc. Also, some lazy modeling: fish look great but they use same model for different species occasionally. DLC is way overpriced for what you get, they need to keep the lakes at the $6-8 range, imo. Big (free) update coming in July 2019 that will add a lot of stuff, and maybe some technical issues will be fixed, as well. Pro Tour Update: So after the big update the game is a much better experience overall. Fish behavior has been tweaked for the better, though sometimes it does take a bit too long to land some fish, particularly regarding smaller specimens. PS4 performance is overall smoother. The added career mode is fun and fits into the game well enough, it will give you something to do in the game even if the devs move on--unlike Fishing Planet, where if the servers ever shut down, you'll be left with absolutely nothing. The UI has changed, and not really for the better imo, but this is a minor nitpick. The store has been merged with the inventory management, which was unnecessary and makes picking out lures tedious unless you own everything, since both owned and not-owned lures co-mingle in the menu--an ""owned"" filter to sort them would be nice. Lure action system is more responsive, I feel, and more quickly recognizes what type of retrieval you're using. 3 new bass lakes have been added for free, and there are named boss fish for all bass lakes.

People were led to believe this was a story heavy RPG - with less focus on the racing only as a means of earning money or experience. The developers liken the game to other JRPG staples like FF, and anime staples like Cowboy Bebop. This can give all sorts of impressions of what your game truly is, so a word of caution there about building hype that AAA devs know all too well about.

Unfortunately AO International Tennis failed to hit the mark in several areas so I was hoping that Tennis World Tour would do a bit better. It does do a bit better than AO International Tennis but this game is far from being a masterpiece and it does suffer with quite a few shortcomings, which ultimately hold the game back. It does however get a few things right and I especially found that to be the case with the licensed player’s that are available to you. Playing as them can be quite fun and they’ve done a good job of including each player’s quirks and mannerisms, which is great. Unfortunately though you can’t trully enjoy the players available to you because the controls don’t always remain responsive and sometimes you end up playing shots that you never went for which can be very frustrating. There is also a problem with the hit detection as well and sometimes my player just completely left the ball and this was infuriating to say the least. I can see some people being put off by the game’s difficulty because it can be a pain to finish off and win a game, especially against the top players. I however found the challenge to be pretty decent and when you finally win a tournament or beat a top player you do get a great sense of achievement. You will however have to put up with some unrealistic behaviour from the AI though along the way. The AI plays shots that don’t look real at times and this is not only frustrating but it also harms the immersion levels as well. In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to get to grips with, but it does need some more. The content also needs more polish in certain areas as well because at times it does play a little rough. Thankfully though the presentation side of the game is not too bad. Visually the game can look decent at times and if more variety was placed into the courts it would be even better. The sound design whilst also good needs a little more variety as well because it can get a bit tedious hearing the same commentary over and over again. At the end of the day Tennis World Tour isn’t a complete failure and it does provide you with some enjoyable moments from time to time, but in the end it just has too many problems at this stage. I will say though that if you want a recommendation about which tennis game you should pick between this and AO International Tennis then I would recommend this, but they’re both a very long way from being perfect.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/tennis-world-tour

Your goal is to essentially find items and keys to help you get to new locations in an area... things start out decently simple and get more convoluted as you go one..For some reason players and critics alike don’t really seem to like this game but I feel like it’s actually pretty neat...there’s an interesting story here told through cut scenes and the occasional flash back moments when you die too many times, you’re getting the story of both you and your neighbor...who by the way is doing all he can to ensure you don’t succeed in collecting these items and keys or solving the puzzles in his yard and basement..This feels very much like an old school early 2000s game with a modern polish...Not to say this game is polished... it has its bugs glitches and hiccups, but for what it is its pretty solid…you’re free to explore the area completely however it’s up to you to figure out how it get into locked doors or find windows to climb through,This old school feel and freedom is the games downfall as well..This game explains nothing to you, it shows you a key in an attic and just lets you go... how are you going to get it… you have to figure things out on your own and for that reason many players will accidentally break the game and miss parts of it, hello neighbor does a really poor job of leading the player along or hinting towards solutions, this is what makes the game so special but what also makes it so frustrating…This isn’t the game’s biggest problem though...That lies in the hands of the over used neighbor...at first dealing with this neighbor is terrifying... He means almost certain death until you figure out how to dodge and set up escape routes in case he spots you... but the problem is at least during the house sections of the game... he’s seemingly everywhere...I’m not sure if he’s spawned into areas, but I’m almost certain he is… this means you never really get a moment away from him and therefor the game never allows tension to build... Its constant inch towards progress get caught rinse and repeat… instead of steak around his home, find out what’s going on. What you need to deal with or figure out to unlock the next part of this map, hide when he gets near and then goes back to his set path....I think this is key to great stealth…Sure you can disrupt paths... but the enemy should always return to their set paths and have a bit of predictability to allow the player to feel they are outsmarting the enemy rather than constant distract and runThis could’ve been a way better game with this in mind.. It has the potential to be a 3d little nightmares game…I still enjoyed it for it was... clearly more than everyone else did...The stealth bit of this stealth game though doesn’t really exist...I give Hello Neighbora 6.5/10",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/hello-neighbor

Not many people actually focus on what is genuinely good and what is genuinely bad about the game, they just follow mob mentality and dismiss it as crap.What Agony does well is provide an overall gaming experience unlike any other. The visuals and level design are some of the best I've ever seen, perfectly evoking what hell would probably be like. It is unrelenting in its use of graphic, taboo imagery and I appreciate that. The sound design, enemies, and atmosphere all come together nicely to bring you to what is probably the closest to hell you can ever be on this Earth. It is truly riveting in that sense.As for gameplay, I liked it. The stealth is tense, the puzzles are satisfying to solve, and there are tons of secrets to acquire, which is always fun. However, there are some glaring faults that drag the gameplay down. The most common enemy in the game kills you in one hit and moves far faster than you. Checkpoints tend to be too far apart at the most stressful of times (which is good sometimes, but most times just frustrating). The soul form mechanic can be truly cumbersome and underexplained (the first time I got captured by one of those tentacle things really confused me). And some sections are just plain tedious to play through. The tedious sections typically involve collect-a-thons amongst a bunch of enemies. Agony is actually at its best when it puts you in situations with little to no enemies, free to explore the grotesque environments. Also, sometimes the game just acts weird, and weird things mess up your progress, which is never fun.I can actually forgive a lot of these flaws, given that it is an indy game from a very small crew. What I can't forgive is the unforgiving challenge at points. Many checkpoints have powerful enemies right next to them, rendering them sometimes unreachable which is very painful. Also, the most common enemy being able to one-hit kill you AS WELL AS shooting insta-kill projectiles at you if you manage to get away... just crazy.Also, some of the animations and cutscenes are just so silly looking, breaking the immersion and intensity. It's at its worst during the final boss of the game. But again, mostly forgivable given the game's upbringing.The story and voice-acting has seen some criticism, but I actually enjoyed it. I found the story dark, cryptic, and intriguing. The Red Goddess is a great character, and her voice acting sold me. She was the perfect depiction of untrustworthy, hellish deviousness. Most NPCs were 100% forgettable, which is fine to me.The graphics also get criticized, which I find ridiculous. The textures are not incredible by today's standards, but the art direction and level design is absolutely breathtaking and wholly disturbing, which I adored. I lost count of the number of times my jaw dropped or I gasped when entering new rooms, vistas, or seeing the brutal tortures on display. I will say I also appreciated the prominence of male genitalia in the game. Female genitalia is not nearly as taboo, so seeing free-flying manly bits was weirdly refreshing.I also appreciate the surprisingly large amount of side content. Agony Mode is an interesting challenge, and the huge number of collectables and also different ways to play through the game can add to some serious replay value.Overall, Agony is an obviously flawed and low-budget game, with the lack of polish and some clunky/tedious game mechanics, but it is definitely better than majority claim. It is a gaming experience that is unlike any other. It pushes the boundaries on how intense and also artistic video game visuals can be, and for the most part offers up intriguing gameplay and an engrossing atmosphere.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/agony

I’m always willing to try anything new no matter how big and small it is and even though you associate shooters with having big production costs sometimes the smaller game’s can provide you with some enjoyable and in the end surprising moments. Gene Rain is a shooter that did surprise me a few times during my playthrough and whilst it did suffer with quite a few shortcomings I did appreciate the effort that has gone into certain areas even if it does fall a little short in the end. Obviously the most important aspect in a game of this ilk is its shooting elements and I’m pleased to say that they did very well with these elements. Shooting enemies felt very satisfying and there is quite a bit of fun to be had when thrown into these sections of the game and in my opinion the shooting elements would’ve been even better if the controls were a little more fluid and responsive. Thankfully though I was able to look past the control issues and that was mainly down to the game’s variety. There is plenty of variety present in the game and I found that to be especially the case when it came to the enemies you have to tackle during your playthrough. Even though the game does have quite a bit of variety included in it I would still recommend that you play the game in intervals because it can get a little tedious and repetetive after a while, but this isn’t a major problem for me though because I find I have to do this with most shooters. In terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to get to grips with and in my opinion the length of the game is absolutely perfect and you do get good value for your money. Of course there’s also a story present in the content that’s avaliable to you as well but I found the story to be a little lacklustre and in the end I lost interest in the story quite quickly, which is a shame. Something I didn’t lose interest in though was the presentation side of the game. Don’t get me wrong the presentation isn’t perfect and the cut-scenes are a little dissapointing, but on the whole I mainly enjoyed both the visuals and sound design and I think they both gave the game quite a bit of character. At the end of the day Gene Rain would have scored higher with me if it didn’t have the few niggling and unnecessary problems it has because as far as shooters go it’s not a bad effort at all and in the end it probably just does enough to get a small recommendation from me.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/gene-rain
