This involves a specific series of button presses to play one of the twelve songs in the game. In the original title, you would need to assign the ocarina to an item slot, then likely review the button prompts to your song, then play them from memory. The Nintendo 3DS version has the ocarina constantly available on the Touch Screen, and playing with the button prompts for each song right in front of you.

Wii MotionPlus technology accurately translates the angle of every sword slice, effectively putting Link's blade in the player's hand. Analyzing enemy attack and defense tendencies and counteracting with precise swings of the sword provide a satisfying experience that blends puzzle-solving with a new and distinctly unique combat system. * Explore a massive, multilayered world that seamlessly blends soaring exploration in a sea of clouds with intense ground-based adventuring that blurs the line between the main world and traditional Zelda dungeons. Link soars through the skies on the back of a noble bird and dives beneath the clouds to the continent below in an epic quest that lays the foundation for the events in the critically acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. * Prepare for intense puzzle-solving as only The Legend of Zelda games can deliver. Exploration of the forests, volcanoes and deserts requires players to think on their feet as they solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and escape deadly traps. Once they find their way to each dungeon, they are confronted by even more puzzles guarded by fiendish enemies. * The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword redefines the traditional Zelda framework and introduces an arsenal of items, upgrades and rewards unlike any game in the franchise to date. The adventure guides players into, out of and back to dungeons and areas they've already completed. Along the way, Link gathers a massive inventory of peculiar items and resources that can be used to upgrade many of his weapons and equipment.  * Every copy in the initial production of the game will come packaged with a special music CD featuring orchestral arrangements of select songs that will be performed at The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Symphony Concert.  * This version of The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword comes packaged with a special Gold Wii Remote Plus controller.

Certain people can't watch a movie unless it has explosions, certain people can't watch Public Television because it educates rather than entertains, and certain people will pick this up on the recommendation of another and feel 100% cheated because it doesn't involve wanton killing, busty women, rampant foul language and guns.If you are one of these types of people, it's okay.  I'm not going to judge you or your tastes.  I'll just let you know that i feel sorry for you, because whatever ""eye of the beholder"" thing it takes to truly enjoy these games, you don't have it, and believe me, your life is worse because of that.  You don't know what you've missed.Ico is definitely the harder game to get into, out of the two games in the collection. It will involve you solving puzzles and leading a girl to safety by escaping the castle where the both of you are imprisoned.  It will involve her speaking in a language you don't understand, and it will tax the part of the brain that won't help you fire a gun.  For those patient enough to brave the journey, you may find yourself with an incredibly emotional experience at the end of the road, and you'll be amazed a video game could make you feel that way.   I'm trying to spoil as little as I can for you, and I'm sorry if this sounds a bit paltry, but this is the gist of the experience.On the other hand, Shadow Of The Colossus is the most beautifully haunting game I've ever played.  It too is about solving puzzles, but the goal in this game is not to figure out how you'll escape a castle, it's how to kill sixteen giant beasts that dwarf you in scale.  No other game has made me feel so overwhelmingly powerful by making me feel so insignificant throughout the entire process - the expansive overworld with no enemies or even epic travel music, the loneliness between your character and the horse he rides, it all seems so pointless until you find your next enemy.  The silence is the calm before the storm, and that storm is the next giant beast you will have to locate, climb and somehow kill.  It will give you a sense of wonder, dread and most of all, it will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that video games deserve to be called an artistic medium. As I said, it won't be for everyone.  But if you find yourself looking for something that could make you proud to own your PlayStation, and you don't mind not shooting a gun or scoring a goal, then you may find yourself in for the best games that the previous generation had to offer.  There's a very good reason why the PlayStation 2 was the home of the best franchise titles of the last hardware generation, and that didn't have as much to to with Grand Theft Auto, Resident Evil, Madden, Final Fantasy or God Of War as it did games like Ico and Shadow Of The Colossus.  Now, these games have been given a 1080p HD facelift, and given trophies for the player to earn as well.  Any individual who considers themselves a gamer, in any sense of the term whether broad or niche, needs to try these two games.  You may find that you don't like them, and like I said earlier, that's okay.  Caviar isn't for everyone, and one man's delicacy can be another's poison.  If you're in the mood for something besides controller McDonalds, though, this is your wake-up call.For those who do pick it up and find themselves lost in the most incredible worlds, your curiosity will be rewarded hundredfold.  Then, you'll understand why people like myself are so excited for The Last Guardian...and chances are, you will be too after playing through these two games (and especially SotC).  Don't pass this up, whatever you do.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/the-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-collection

Yes the game was a month late, yes DX11 features will slow down your game, when it should, in fact, speed it up, yes there is SecuRom, and yes its on GWFL. However, none of that really matters, a month later? Who fricking cares, yes I had some of it spoiled, but I should have kept away from the batman forums to be sure. Still the story keeps me intrigued, the combat is insanely good, and the atmosphere is amazing. Can't do much about GFWL and SecuRom, they don't make the game worse, they are just bad choiced to safeguard against people playing without paying. The DX11 thing is something that they already are aware of, and they will fix it. So, if your that angered by it, wait before you buy it, or if you already bought it, don't play until the patch is out. Until that patch there are lots of goodies to play meanwhile, like Skyrim and Battlefield 3.As stated earlier this games combat is awesome, and works even better on mouse and keyboard than its predecessor. I have had no troubles whatsoever, and the troubles I did have came from me not being used to the combat system, not because it was bad.The graphics are gorgeous beyond belief, even in DX9 it looks good, I can also run at almost max with max PhysX on my GTX460, only thing I have turned down is AA at 16x .The sound is awesome, including the voice acting, The Joker is especially, like last game, really good. But most all of the voice acting done here is awesome.I can't find any fault with this game other than the DX11 problem, and that will be fixed, so a solid 10/10 and this game leaves me wondering what will be GOTY. To me it is between this, battlefield 3 (the MP is sooooo solid), The Witcher 2 and Skyrim. All are 9 or 10 out of 10 in my book.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/batman-arkham-city

It's gameplay is very realistic and makes you think like a real football player, in defensive as well as offensive manners. It's hard to get into the tactical defending, especially against Legendary CPU players. It forces you to think ahead, see the spaces, and anticipate your opponent's moves to win the ball back. No longer you can just simply win the ball back without going through too much trouble, which I like. Even if you'd turn off tactical defending and switch back to the ""old"" defensive controls, it's harder than in previous Fifa games.As for the impact engine, in my opinion this feature is not useless at all and makes the game feel very realistic and alive. Emotions can run high while something is not going the way you expect it to be, as well as positive as negative emotions... That's the way it goes down on a real football field too.

If you are a fan of Strategy RPGS, BUY THIS GAME.  The story is by far my favorite of any SRPG.  When I first heard about a remake, I figured it was going to be like all the other remakes and have very little new content.  This game feels almost completely different, with tons of changes, additions, and notably the removal of the training mode.  This review will focus mostly on the changes. One of the most noticeable changes is the fact that you level jobs instead of individual characters.  So what I always did was have 1 character per job so that you can keep all your jobs leveled.  Because of this change and the fact that there is no training mode, I found the first couple battles (after your training buddies leave you) very difficult.  Also, experience is gained throughout the battle and at the end it's divided up through all your characters.  This is great, because when you begin leveling a new job they can basically stand in the back at level 1 and not risk getting killed. Another change during battle is the fact that you can retrace your ""steps"" or character moves.  If you've played the original you understand the fact that sometimes these battles can last an hour, and one wrong move can cost you the battle and lose a vital character.  So in order to aleviate a lot of the frustration you are now actually able to backtrack to any move you want (up to 50 moves) by pressing and holding the ""L"" button.  A lot of people will consider this cheating, but this is just an option, and if you're a die hard fan -- just ignore it. Another important change is the fact that you can customize each individual character by buying spells and abilities.  This feature resembles Final Fantasy Tactics and the use of Job Points.  The  difference is that you are only able to hold a specified number of skills and abilities.  Because of that, each character is unique -- sorta.  This feature was probably the first feature I did not like.  It grew on me as the game progressed, but originally I felt like I was basically buying the same skills for my melee and the same skills for my mages.  The act of trying to make unique characters ended up just being repetative for the first few chapters.  The fact remains that these skills are crucial.  Without knowing what you're doing, the first few battles were difficult to me until I mastered the purchasing of these skills. Probably the most important change to me is the fact that you can replay the game by going back to specific  points where you have to make game changing choices and pick a difference choice to see the other outcome.  Now die hard fans like me, already did this on the original but this was done by restarting a new game and losing all your hard work.  In this remake you can take your party of characters and go back to those important moments.  This basically allows you to recruit all those members you were unable to get to form the perfect party.  One other sidenote is the music.  The music and sound effects are AMAZING.  I remember when I was a little kid, whenever I heard music from FFVII or Xenogears it would have a great effect on me.  I would get so excited to play it, and even to this day there's a sense of nostalgia.  This game has THAT type of music. Although this game isn't for anyone, if strategy rpgs like Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgaea, Advanced Wars, Jeanne d'Arc, etc. are appealing to you, then you have to try this game.  And if you loved the original, but you're still debating about buying the PSP remake, just remember -- It feels like a new game, plus there's characters you always wanted to recruit in the original, that you can get in the remake.  I won't give it away in this review, but a simple Google and you should be able to find it.",https://metacritic.com/game/psp/tactics-ogre-let-us-cling-together

It caused quite as stir, and many and most (including me) tought it was going to be another failed re-hash. But boy were we wrong. Ubisoft had a golden oppurtunity to bring rayman back into the digital world, and they used that oppurtunity to make the best platformer EVER! Yes it's 2D but if crysis was 2D Rayman whould have better graphics. Everything is hand-drawn and animated as smooth as possible.  The enviroment, character animations and basically everything is breathtaking. The only problem is to fully enjoy every aspect of Rayman Origins you need to play at 1080p. At this resolution you can take everything in and you will feel as if your in a new world. The gameplay is smooth and challenging. This game makes Mario look like Dora the explorer. The 4 player co-op is as fun as it could be. The gameplay is perfect. Now $60 for a 2D platformer is expensive, but this isn't your average platformer.  THIS IS RAYMAN! If your a fan of Rayman or just enjoy a brilliant platformer you should stop reading this now and go buy it. If all the Rayman games coming is like this, I say well done Ubisoft. Well done.

Well, kind of. It may not appear as instantly striking in terms of awesomness the original did with its lush, tropical setting but it's in the finer details and when things really escalate in the single player that will blow your mind. The sheer 'destructional' splendour of New York under alien siege has to be seen and played to behold. Seeing screenshots and a few gameplay trailers does not do it justice unless you're sitting there, at your desktop, plugged into your HDTV or whatever, with full surround-sound and maybe even 3D, escaping a sinking sub yourself. This being said, graphics don't make a game. And with such refined gameplay, it sure as hell doesn't make Crysis 2.For the core gameplay of Crysis 2, I was initially disappointed about the nanosuit's powers being reduced to stealth and armour. That quickly changed, however. Having a button for each made switching between the two far more fluid than Crysis 1. On top of this, it adds a lovely twist and breath of fresh air to what is essentially your typical combat multiplayer affair. That being said, it is a step down from the large  scale frantic antics of the original. But it's this added layer of depth to the tried and tested 'CoD-style' multiplayer offering that lends it an advantage.But it was the single-player, like its predecessor, I bought it for. The original garnered some criticism to its rather basic plot, but having never seen it done so well, or in a videogame for that matter, it didn't hinder the experience one bit. Crysis 2, however, propels the Crysis universe onto a whole new level. It's obvious a hell of a lot more thought has been put into it. It's more complex, deeper and smart and makes for infinitely more compelling game. Couple this with the unique and shockingly-real depiction of an apocalyptic New York and well...

I thought back to the ps2 era MK games and few positive adjectives came to my mind. Add to that the underwhelming MK vs. DC Universe of a few years ago and my hopes were decidedly bottom of the barrel when it came to MK9. But this morning I got a call from my brother this morning at 1:30 saying he had just picked up MK9 and was coming over. Now, you have to understand that I haven't heard from my brother in over a year. To make a long story short, at our parent's funeral in Winter 2010 there was a huge fight. My brother told me and the other siblings he would never speak to us again. It hurt to hear my big brother regard us so harshly and honestly, the last year has been hell for me. So when I heard from him this morning it was quite the shock.When he got here we exchanged few words and proceeded to start up the game on my 50"" HD TV. I was hesitant at first and refused to play versus mode to start, telling my brother to simply play story mode while I watched. It didn't take us long to realize how magnificent this game truly was. During one of the early cutscenes my brother let out in amazement ""it's like they're rewriting my childhood, hell yes."" I don't want to spoil anything for you, but the story mode is the most awesomely presented story in fighting game history. I'm not ashamed to say there were a few high fives exchanged amongst us when we finally beat the last bosses. I had to get my hands on all the characters after that. We immediately went into versus and started taking eachother on just like we had in MKII for the SNES. It was one of the best experiences of my life. The gameplay isn't hard to get into and I can tell there's going to be a lot of room to get better. Maybe one day I'll even be able to beat big bro!So as 7AM hit us and we decided to get some rest, I realized something. None of the old hardships came back to light. This was fun like My brother and I hadn't experienced in ages. Fun I thought I had lost forever. Through all the gore and friendly competition we both realized what makes us equals as men, but more importantly, what made us equal as brothers.

As for the core game, however, I was initially disappointed about the nanosuit's power being reduced to stealth and armour. That quickly changed, however. Having a button for each made switching between the two far more fluid than Crysis 1. On top of this, it adds a lovely twist and breath of fresh air to what is essentially your typical combat multiplayer affair. That being said, it is a step down from the large  scale frantic antics of the original. But it's this added layer of depth to the tried and tested 'CoD-style' multiplayer offering that lends it an advantage.But it was the single-player, like its predecessor, I bought it for. The original garnered some criticism to its rather basic plot, but having never seen it done so well, or in a videogame for that matter, it didn't hinder the experience one bit. Crysis 2, however, propels the Crysis universe onto a whole new level. It's obvious a hell of a lot more thought has been put into it. It's more complex, deeper and smart and makes for infinitely more compelling game. Couple this with the unique and shockingly-real depiction of an 'apocalyptic' New York and well...

Still all you do is splode, but the levels are remarkably more complex.  The one complaint that some might have is that the game requires you to complete a sequence of moves throughout levels without any warning- ie. you'll land on a platform only to be crushed by spikes a second later because you didn't know to immediately jump when you landed there.  YOU WILL DIE PLAYING THIS GAME, and probably a lot.  The difficulty is much higher than the original.  That said, there are not any games anywhere near similar to this game (except for its predecessor).  A well written dialogue also makes Ms. Splosion man worth playing just to hear what she'll say next (she's a mixture of a ditsy high schooler and someone who quotes romance movies- its quite funny).  My one recommendation is to play Splosion Man first- it'll be a nice warmup for this game.

Owning nearly all of the previous YDKJ games on the PC, I've always been a huge fan, and it was the game of choice in my dorm room with friends. Upon hearing of a console release with a four-player limit, episodic format (which I remember from The Ride), and some altered mechanics to make things more fair, I had a very good feeling for this version. However, I was turned off hardcore upon discovering that the Jack Attack was based on the flash version of the game (Huh?) and that there were no gibberish questions, one of my favorite things in the previous games. I can understand not having gibberish questions in a console game, since there's no keyboard, and typing in answers would take forever, and I'll let that slide. So let's run down the list of things that are important here. One, the episodic format, which you likely remember from The Ride more than anything else, is *not* based on themes. In The Ride, every ""episode"" had a certain theme, like alcohol, or the government, or celebrities, or something like that. It wasn't a perfect system because right off the bat you'd know who'd have the advantage in the episode. For instance, if the episode was about computers, and one of you is a computer technician while another is a political science major with little computer experience, you know right away who's going to win. So, while this is avoided since each episode has no specific theme, it's still misleading to call these things ""episodes"" when the questions have virtually no connection. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is the way questions are answered, which is vastly different from any other YDKJ game. First of all, all players can answer, rather than a single player buzzing in and earning the prize. It's conceivable that every single person can get the answer right, and there is no special bonus for being the first to answer. Instead, how much money you get from a question isn't based on the question itself; all questions are worth an equal amount of money (doubled in round two), and the amount you get decreases as the clock runs down. It's very simple: If you buzz in with 14 seconds left, you get $1400, or $2800 if it's round two. Buzz in with two seconds left, and you get $200. All multiple-choice questions have an identical value, sans special rounds. This system actually tends to work, especially for wireless controllers, because if only one person buzzed in and answered, that person might just have the advantage of being closer to the TV, or being wired. It's arguably a nice new mechanic that helps ease the game along. The Dis-Or-Dats have also been changed somewhat. In previous versions, there was nothing complicated about them: You had two or three choices for each word or phrase, and you picked the right one to earn money, or picked the wrong one to lose it. This version makes things a little more complicated. First, the amount of money you earn is largely based on how quickly you can answer all the items correctly, and the time left afterward is a bonus in addition to the regular value of the items. The second thing is that other players no longer totally sit out in this round, and now have a role to play. If the main player of the Dis-Or-Dat gets an item wrong, and other players buzz in the correct answer *before* the main player answers, they will all share the money earned, which is considered a ""steal"". It's great that there is now an opportunity for other players to join in the Dis-Or-Dats, rather than having all but one player sit out completely.However, not everything here is perfect. Let's just get this out of the way: the flash version of the Jack Attack just isn't as good as the ones that came before it. In fact, it seemed like the Jack Attacks got progressively worse as time went on, and were made less and less intense. And here, we have, in my opinion, the least likable Jack Attack created. It's very busy, not particularly tension-building, and just noisy, but not in a good way. I would have vastly preferred an earlier version of the Jack Attack, maybe even the original, or The Ride. There's also one other really, really huge problem with the Jack Attack: Whereas most games before this one had answers worth $2k each, this one does them at an unreal $4k each, which is simply not right. Keep in mind that questions are all fixed in value, and all things considered, $4k is an obscene amount of money. You can understand, then, that you can absolutely suck at the main game, but come back and win in the Jack Attack. At some point, you just have to draw the line on how much of a game-breaker a Jack Attack can be. One unlucky category and all your hard work goes down the drain. So, some things are lacking, and some things work. Is it worth it? Sure.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/you-dont-know-jack

I will always and forever be mad at EA for removing the ability to build your swing.  That to me was the best feature they ever had in the game franchise.  Needless to say, you can still do the game face, bringing some reality into the game.  Although the skin mapping and textures still need a little work, it looks about 90% of what you look like.  Being an avid golfer, putting Augusta into the game means the world.  There is just something about the course that other course in the game just don't have.  The course itself in the game is AMAZING looking.  You can really tell that doing the laser scans of each hole has made a huge difference in graphics.  I'm really looking forward to them doing this for all the courses in the game. As for play in the game, it's definitely better.  The caddie is nice to have, but he can get pretty annoying as I prefer to hit the shots I want to hit anyways.  Sometimes he will give you a good idea of how you could play the hole or a certain shot, some non golfers don't always understand how being creative on the golf course can pay off (hook, slice, punch ....).  I really like that you have a wider variance in your shot.  What I mean is in the previous versions, you aimed to a spot and your shot hit the spot as long as you didn't sway too far from the center on the swing or percentage of the shot.  In the new game, you might think you hit it dead straight, but no golfer is perfect and unless you use some focus, there is a wider area where the ball can and does go.  It brings you back to the reality of playing golf in the real world, not just some computer based game that hits perfect every time, what fun is that? The lie on the grass now affects your ball more and you can also now check to see what it is.  How amazing is it that on a side hill lie with the ball above my feet that it will actually hook, but more amazing is that I can check that number and adjust correctly for it, about time EA. You now have the ability to choke down on your clubs, how freaking awesome is that?  I can't tell you how many times I do this when I normally play to take distance off a shot and now I can do the same in the game, very nice addition. I'm also glad they got rid of the giant BOOM every time you hit the ball, wow, that got pretty annoying. Although the transition sound between shots has a ton of bass and my sub really goes nuts on it.  The music in the game is great though, it's simple and fits with golf very well.  Previous years had really hip hoppy music, which is fine, but doesn't really fit with playing The Masters.  Don't plan on playing in The Masters during your first season in the regular tour, because you probably won't have the tour ranking to get in.  This is great and gives the game some much needed replay value.  The Masters moments are amazing too, being able to hit shots that were key to years past, wow, can't say how much fun that is.  All in all, it's a giant leap forward from 2011 and my only gripes are that you can't turn the caddies off for good, or that you have to buy certain courses to play all the tournaments during the year.  Otherwise, worth every penny.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/tiger-woods-pga-tour-12-the-masters

Without mana and creeps, the game has almost zero downtime and is instead based on short cooldowns, this coupled with the absence of elements such as grind and farming ensures that every match is full of action.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/bloodline-champions

Having now played for around 10 hours I can say with a measured opinion that it has met and surpassed all my expectations.  I completed Origins and poured over 112 hours into the game.  I am by no means a simple fan boy and would have been bitterly disappointed had I not thought Bioware had put the same level of skill and commitment into the sequel.  I have not been disappointed and I fail to see where and why all the user criticism spawns from on this page.  I loved Origins and I feel no hesitation in stating that I believe DA2 is a much improved game.The pacing is much faster and more exciting, whilst keeping the focus of the narrative throughout - something Origins failed to do at times (there's a Blight going on?).The action and fighting dynamics have seriously been improved.  Remember people this is the Xbox 360 version we are reviewing and as a console version, it's fighting mechanics have been vastly improved.  It's fluid, it's faster and ultimately, it's more exciting.  There seems to be a theme arising that people believe it is more like a button basher now.  Can I remind you that the sole difference there is that now rather than simply pressing A once and having the character automatically attack, you now do so yourself.  I fail to see why this is a negative.The story is gripping and the character dynamics and interaction is as superb as it was in the original but with the vast improvement of a fully voiced character.  Furthermore, the characters are equally as funny, original and likeable as they were in the original - with the exception of maybe Morrigan (a favourite of mine).The graphics are, as expected, a considerable improvement and the scale of Kirkwall is impressive.  Another complaint stems from the fact that the majority of the game is played within it's boundaries but this is by no means a bad thing.  In fact, it makes perfect sense for the story which is being portrayed.Please, if you are considering buying this game, do not be put off by the overtly harsh criticism on this site and do so.  If you are a fan of rpgs and most particularly if you enjoyed the first game, I implore you to play this game: you will not regret it.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dragon-age-ii

This is virtual tourism at it's best. The world is highly detailed and feels and looks very realistic and is on a level with Rockstar titles. I think R* and the Yakuza Team are by far the best developers when it comes to Open World, Sandbox games. Yakuza 4 is very story driven like the Metal Gear Series and has a ton of high quality cutscenes and massive dialogues. If you want to completely dive in in a video game universe with japan/yakuza themes then this game is heaven. I think Yakuza 4 is one of the best games if not the best game for PS3!",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/yakuza-4

If you have any interest in Suda 51's dark humour & art style as a developer, then this game will not disappoint you. Shadows of the Damned is a perfect combination of eerie & hilarious, and while graphically the game doesn't break any new ground, the game more than makes up for it with it's stylistic visuals and unorthodox gameplay elements. Not to mention, the musical score is a unique achievement all its own; which can only be described as Silent Hill meets Planet Terror. The combat, more often than not, is intense and enjoyable; and the boss battles are fun & challenging without being frustrating. My only gripe is that the controls can feel a bit clunky & sluggish at times, but not any more so than say Resident Evil 4. The one-button 180 degree turn mechanic helps remedy this to some degree, but on occasion the sprint button does feel unresponsive (and it really should have been mapped to L3 instead of R1). Again, this is a minor gripe, and it doesn't occur frequently enough to hurt the gameplay. Aside from that, the game does feel like it will probably clock in at around 10 hours. However, I'm playing on the hardest difficulty, so I'm probably looking at about 12 hours. Personally I'm okay with this. The light & dark gameplay mechanic is somewhat similar to what is found in Alan Wake (and is executed just as well), but it definitely has the Suda 51 trademark -- shooting munching goat heads as light sources, and igniting fireworks machines instead of boring flood lights. Goat heads you say? Yes... absolutely. And even the game's main character is as baffled as you. Upon discovering this, he aptly replies: ""What do I have to do to unlock a door? F##K a horse?"" Buy this game now. Support creative game development.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/shadows-of-the-damned

The multiplayer battles got support for 32 players and the game mode is called Conquest. You battle for 4 control points and for dynamic objectives to win the match, it`s very much like the conquest mode in the Battlefield games but with more things happening (like dynamic objectives). The objectives can be to kill a VIP player or to kill a bunch of players, but it can also be about protecting things or attacking things like a transport. Then you got a mode called Swarm, it`s a co-op game type which you can play either by yourself with bots or with up to 3 friends, the objective is to protect a capture point from enemy AI soldiers for 15 minutes, this game mode is very fun indeed. ItÂ´s like the survival mode in Left 4 Dead but with some nice tower defense added to spice all up. When you kill enemies you gain money both in Swarm and in Conquest and with that money you can buy vehicles and turrets, it`s a very important part of the game and makes it more tactical. All in all this is a great game which you should buy if your a fan of FPS games and for just 15$ dollars you aren`t exactly taking a big risk, and i bet you will like the game when you learnt the basics.

I love the fact that you control nature and not your men live every other god sim, that gives this a really fresh twist - which is exactly what the god sim genre needed. Sure there is a massive puzzle solving element to From Dust, but there always is to god sims and anyone who says otherwise would be lying or so well practiced at the same old god sim games they don't need to think about it (people who played every Age of Empires, Civ, Sim City etc. game would probably have to think a lot less than people like me who play god sims occasionally and don't want to have to watch several hours of tutorials just to be able to start playing like Civ 4). I found From Dust fun, pretty and addictive. Having completed the main story I am working through the challenge mode which is really cool too. The only thing I would change with From Dust is that I would make it longer in the main story - but the cheaper price reflects the shorted game so it's fair enough. I can't wait for From Dust 2, but I will probably replay From Dust a few times before it hopefully comes out.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/from-dust

The new environments are much more varied and colourful. Combat is as fun as ever and Tallis is granted her own special abilities that fit in with the style of her character traits. For 800 points i feel i have spent my money wisely and i think this DLC is proof that designers, when they communicate with their audience as Bioware have, are capable of crafting an experience that allows them to maintain a creative flair as well as cater to the wishes of the public. This DLC is fun, has interesting characters and presents a story that helps expand the Dragon Age universe and its people. A solid 7.

The thing I like the most about ""Edge"" is that you can choose your ""level of difficulty"" in each stage for your own. If you decide to only go for the exit it will be pretty easy. There are a lot of checkpoints and they are mostly placed fair and reasonable. If you are playing this way ""Edge"" ist a normal platformer and getting to the end is not a question of knowing where to go but of your ability to move the cube the way you want. The next step would be collecting all the prisms scattered through the levels which is still easy although you have to think for some of them. The next thing to do is trying to get better times either way for the S+-rank (you need to collect all prisms for that) or competing for the leader-boards (just getting to the end the fastest way possible). At this point I would consider ""Edge"" as a puzzle-platformer since you need to find out what the best route is, where you should go first, looking for shortcuts and paying attention to timing for moving platforms etc. You also have to consider where you can and have to use the Edge-Time which is basically your cube clinging to a wall with just one edge. All the time spent as Edge-time will later on not be counted to your total time and therefore influence your results largely. So getting the best time possible is not only a question of sheer ability but also cleverness and like I said before is the part of the game I, personally, would consider as a puzzle.Although the graphic is minimalistic most levels give a different feeling and are unique and interesting with many interesting themes. Beside the games main 48 levels there is a free DLC with another 44 brilliant levels and additional 17 levels can be obtained by joining the Edge group at least if you are playing on Steam. To round this experience up the game comes with a catchy soundtrack which mostly will not annoy you.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/edge-2011

However, I enjoy soccer video games and since the 3DS library is so limited, I gave PES 2011 3D a try, and am glad I did.The 3D in this game is very cool! The first time you see the players running around the screen they seem more like ants inside a box rather than a flat video screen. So cute! The default camera is not really usable since you don't see enough of the field and takes too long panning around. I recommend the vertical view since it really enhances the 3D effect and also matches the radar view so you don't have to mentally rotate it in your mind. The 3D is particularly helpful for long kicks since you can better judge the height and depth of the ball in the air. It's easier to complete long passes and prepare your receiver to trap the ball. It definitely enhances the gameplay and is not just a gimmick for the sake of 3D.Since I'm not a hardcore soccer fan, it doesn't bother me that all the licensed teams aren't up to date. In fact, I'm thrilled to support any company that competes with EA since they would rather buy exclusive licenses than compete fairly on merit. The only little problems I have with the game is that it forces you to watch replays of every goal and generally makes you hit the 'start' button to skip stuff way too often - which is not the best button on the 3DS. Also, no online play is a major disappointment as well. Also think it is overpriced. I wish they would offer a stripped down version on the eStore without the actual player names for around $10-15.The game itself is lots of fun and very competitive. You can set the difficulty level to get the game about where you want it, and then choose your teams to finely tweak how challenging it is.

There wasn't a whole lot of hype about it, and at the same time there haven't been a whole lot of exciting releases for me lately.  I started watching this game close to release, and got excited at the fact that I might be able to go on a good dungeon crawl.Once i started getting into the game, I found the whole experience to be very positive.  Graphically the game was nice, and the structure to the game was that of a typical dungeon crawler.  The backstory was interesting, and I got involved with the character to the extent where I really cared about making a difference to the Legion and trying to restore us to glory.On top of that, the amount of loot was amazing- any true fan of an RPG with lots of loot will be at home with this one.  The character development was satisfying enough, with the ability of earn EXP and level up your character down the path that you see fit.  In terms of your abilities and their specialisations, you wont be able to unlock everything- so choices will have to be made.  To me, that is a big part of a good RPG- choices which mean you totally forgo other choices.The combat was great, it was smooth, intuitive and satisfying.  Once you get a hang for the 2 stances and your characters abilities, then you will be able to seriously kick some enemy ass.  The combat still had a good level of strategy to it, whilst feeling action packed at the same time.One semi-downside is the short time, even if you go through and complete all side quests and explore/re-explore sections of the world, it will probably take between 15-20 hours for most people.  For an RPG this  is relatively short, however it sort of felt right for this game- it definitely achieves what it needed to.  A saving grace to this fact is that there are 4 totally different characters, each of which play very differently, so you can play through with each of them once- this will add to re-playability greatly.I have played through twice so far- once on normal setting, and the next on the hardcore/nightmare setting.

When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology.

They werenÂ´t exactly challenging , and despite a few cosmetic changes what we have here ItÂ´s basically the same game: ClichÃ© characters (based in ye good old archetipes), endless corridors (full of monsters and loot) and extremely linear gameplay (well, at least here you actually have to click on the enemies for the character to attack taking away a bit of the Â¨interactive screensaverÂ¨ feeling  of the series). With the controls I had no issue wathsoever.About the story, I think itÂ´s an improvement over the prequels (where it was almost non existant). ItÂ´s a bit darker, predictable yes, but well written, and the humour is still there, itÂ´s a different kind, a bit more sophisticated without going to extremes.Besides that, I beg to differ about the voice acting and companion ai, for me is was pretty good. Whenever the lead character falls, there is a good chance for the companion to resurrect him.All in all, if you take it without inflated expectations (what we have here is yet another diablo clone) itÂ´s a pretty good and polished little game (not one bug I found, a new landmark for Obsidian).

It's definitely a solid game with a bunch of laughs. And if you think Stacking is always cheesy, that is where you are wrong. Of course, I am here to review the DLC, not the actual game. However, had I reviewed the game itself, I would have given the game a 9 for how well made it was made, although I would have panned that the hints made the game feel too easy to get all of the challenges.The Lost Hobo King is rather cheap, I must say. I honestly expected the DLC to be something that of 560 MSP or 800 MSP, but THQ and Double Fine were kind to have the price as just 400MSP! The story of the DLC is rather simple. Charlie travels to the kingdom of ""Camelfoot"" with Levi (who you may remember from the main game as the guy who created monuments of Charlie's adventures). Charlie is to help uncover the lost crown, so that Levi's uncle can become king of the Hobo's. You are to try and find three blacksmiths, whom of which are the only three people who can create the lost crown. The DLC will possibly take you around half an hour to complete if you were just trying to speed run through it, although if you were like me (I was trying to get 100% achievements on Stacking as the DLC was the remaining achievements I needed), you may want to try and collect everything, in which case, it could take you more than an hour and a half.If you don't know the way of Stacking, it is rather simple. You are a very small Matryoshka doll, and every character in the game is also a Matryoshka doll. You need to stack inside other dolls in order to solve puzzles to progress to the next stage. Stacking inside other dolls allows you to do comical stuff, such as in the new DLC, you can stack inside a bunny. If you hop near people, they will also hop for fun. Another is a person wearing a submarine helmet with fish hooks all around it. You can use the ability, in which the submarine will destroy any dolls that get in the way of the hooks. Rather cool, huh? The DLC adds 15 unique dolls, and a bunch of regulars which you will see all over the map. Most of the dolls abilities are unique to those from the main game, so Double Fine have certainly outdone themselves.The DLC also adds 10 new Hi-Jinks. A couple of them you can work on your own, but a couple may take you a while to figure out, or may force for you to look up how to solve them. Hi-Jinks are challenges you need to complete. Since there are ten, I suppose I could spoil one: ""Smoked Meat"" - Use the ""Smoke Out"" ability on any doll with a meat hat.You need to do that one five times in order to complete the Hi-Jink. Believe it or not, that was the final Hi-Jink I needed before I got 100% achievements. Speaking of which, the game comes with four achievements. They are the same as those from the main game, which are to just complete the DLC's story, unlock all the Hi-Jinks, collect all unique dolls and find all the ways to complete the challenges.Again, like the main game, the hints allowed you to work out all the challenges by yourself, which it's always tweaks like these why games are getting too easy. Although, this game does seem to appeal to children (sort of), so I suppose Double Fine had to consider that. Also, you know how a lot of games seem to have zombies? Umm... well there's something I should tell you. Come closer child... closer... *whispers* There are also Zombies in the DLC! *returns to normal voice* (UPDATE: They're actually called Ghouls. I felt I had to Tim, even though you said it didn't matter. They're zombies to me!)Stacking is no doubt a lot of fun, and even though it's set out like a silent film, it never gets in the way on how enjoyable it is. For 400MSP, I think this is a perfect slice. If this was priced at 560MSP, I may have had a few things to say. At 800MSP, I would be fuming. If you loved the main game, you will think of the Lost Hobo as another appealing mission as if it was already in the game itself. I can't help but wonder though... is there a gallery which tracks your collectables like in the main game with Levi?http://www.nave360.com/review-the-lost-hobo-king-stacking-dlc/ for actual review.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/stacking-the-lost-hobo-king

The swords actually give you a different approach of gameplay (the fast, the normal and the slow one), the gun is just different on how you shoot (the ""sniper"" rifle, the rapid fire and the mortar), while the shields are just different on the speed of ""opening"", but usually you'll go for the best in stats: these aren't bad details but in general you'll just go for one ""style"" in each slot and probably never change. Second: the game is challenging but in a sort of ""wrong way"": the new monsters are gonna be tough to beat fast and that's ok...but later you'll basicly fight the same monsters again, but with 1) different elemental attribute 2) together with X number of monsters. It surely is challenging but I would have prefered harder monsters to beat instead of beating 4 of them all at once. And third...no online?! What the hell did you make a multiplayer-based game for if there's no online feature! Unless you find friends with a psp and a copy of this game you'll just play alone doing those missions on your own, which leads to the fourth and last ""rant"" from me: the game gets very repetitive very fast and I got tired very quickly of doing the same areas (which are few, I gotta say...) for the same kind of mission (kill the monsters and you're done). I'm gonna give it a 7 because I enjoyed this game but I REALLY wanted different missions (we're in a post-apocalyptic world and none asks me to find stuff for them?) and more weapon choices (big swords are cool but they can get tiring after a while).",https://metacritic.com/game/psp/gods-eater-burst

It has soothing music and fun visuals.    I've loved pilotwings (all of them) and the Wii Sports Resort game which is similar in many ways to pilotwings.    The challenge is there and the fun factor is way up.    the graphics are nice and the music really puts you in the mood to play.   You get to use a rocketbelt, plane, and a hang glider.   the hang glider for me was the most fun of the three but the rocketbelt is up there.   you fly over an island chain which has many visuals that the wii sports resort didn't.    This is one of the best pilotwings ever made.    I especially liked Pilotwings 64 and hope they release it on the VC.    this game has more achievements it seems than other pilotwings.    there are also surprise things about this game where you get to use different vehicles and flying abilities.  But i won't tell you what.    So far I've played this game over 7 hours and still am unable to finish it.   I'm not sure why people are saying its easy cause to me it isn't.

You decide the role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge for humanity. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more. A man-made floating city called the Ark, made up of hundreds of separate floating islands, is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% ""green"" habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth's oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It's up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race. Blurring the Lines Between Offline and Online - Advance your character’s development across every gameplay mode: single player, co-op, and multiplayer. Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics. This competitive lead on the squad-combat genre helps thrust players into the gritty reality of the Ark's epic secluded arcology. [Bethesda Softworks]",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/brink

Originally built as an experimental self-sufficient and 100% ""green"" habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth's oceans has forced the Ark to become a refuge for humanity.  Crammed with the original Ark founders, their descendants, as well as tens of thousands of refugees, the Ark exists in total isolation from the rest of the world. With 25 years of social unrest, the inhabitants of the Ark have reached their breaking point. It's up to you to decide the future of the Ark and the human race.

Gain experience points that you can spend on customizing and upgrading your skills and abilities, designing an entirely unique look and feel for your character. Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you're used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and takes advantage of a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. No need to perfectly time a jump or vault, the game knows what you want to do. Objectives, communications, mission generation, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your status, your location, your squad-mates, and the status of the battle in all gameplay modes.  You'll always know exactly where to go, what to do when you get there, and what your reward will be for success. Brink’s proprietary technology, Virtual Texturing, breaks new ground on current-gen consoles and PCs with an even greater focus on highly detailed characters, realistic environments, lighting, effects, and atmospherics.

Интересно рассматривать как работают люди на платформах, хоть и раздражает, что они проходят сквозь двери.Разработчики уделили внимание и постапокалиптическим декорациям: хибары-трущобы в американских каньонах, затопленные мегаполисы, азиатские деревеньки ""на плаву"" около которых маленькие азиатские ""водяные огороды"", так же азиатские буддисткие храмы на камнях с зеленью вокруг, азиатские фермеры на азиатских галерах и промышленный район. В общем, очень интересно рассматривать декорации постапокалиптического мира. В данной игре это сделано на ура. + Кампания тоже получилась тоже очень неплохо: в игре есть неплохое разнообразие миссий (сопроводить мирных житилей, уйти от погони северных друзей, удержать НПЗ и так далее). На сложном уровне играть поинтереснее. +Так же интересная улучшение веток способностей: защита, атака и ""третье не знаю"" (хоть всегда третье и улучшаю) + Игра не требовательна к железу - Короткая кампания, хотелось хотя бы какого-нибудь DLC с дополнительными миссиями. - Неинтересно играть с ИИ. Легко победить троих сложных компьютеров в союзе. - Слишком мало карт, хотелось бы побольше. - Так же хотелось бы в сражениях поиграть с большим количеством игроков/ИИ. Например карта на 10 игроков. Было бы интереснее, чем на 4. - Немного раздражает, что в игре по факту существует только две фракции (деление по виду техники): рейнджеры и остальные. Сделали бы разного вида внешний облик техники красных, северян и азиатов. Поставил игре 10/10 лишь потому, чтобы игра дотянуда до 70, так как считаю, что игра заслуживает 73 балла metascore и поддерживаю отечественного производителя.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/oil-rush

I am a massive RPG and Bioware fan from the Baldur's Gate era and have always felt confident that I will get my money's worth when purchasing one of their titles. Purely from an entertainment perspective, I always compare video game investments to movie theater pricing. Where I live, a movie ticket will run you $12 or more for 2-hours of entertainment (assuming you don't spend the additional obligatory $20 on soda, popcorn et al). So spending $60 on a Bioware game that provides 80+ hours of solid entertainment and story-telling that is often better written and voice-acted than most movies today...it is kind of a no-brainer. I personally feel that DA:O was the best RPG ever made (yes...Nostalgic Ones...better than BG2!). Was DA2 perfect? No. It did feel rushed and the repetitive environments did drive me crazy but...the characterization, story-telling and continued world-building was fantastic. I played it twice and (based on my movie theater comparison) felt I definitely got my money's worth. The amount of time, effort and finesse that goes into making these things is astounding to me. The almost rabid vitriol surrounding DA2 makes me concerned that Bioware will throw up their hands and abandon this great story. Removing myself from the maelstrom of herd-mentality negativity surrounding DA2 and comparing Legacy in an objective manner to other similarly-priced DLC, I thought it was great! I paid $10 for 3-hours of enjoyable entertainment. I recently spent $13 (before snacks) to see Captain America.

You race through the 2010 Sprint Cup season against a field made up of most of the 2010 regular Cup teams and some high profile Nationwide and Truck Series drivers.  Aside from unlocking alternate paint schemes, there is no progression element in the game.  You begin with a top quality Sprint Cup team and do not  upgrade your car or progress to a better team.  A series of short 'Invitational' events also become available as you advance through the season which highlight some of the features of the game.  A practice mode lets you work on the setup of your car to find some speed when the default setup doesn't suit you. --- I experienced a lot of frustration trying to find a combination of difficulty settings that made the single player game consistently enjoyable for me.  There are a number of driver assist settings to experiment with although even with all of these turned off the car was rarely challenging to control.  AI skill level is more of a problem.  On most settings, I usually pull away to a 3 second lead within a few laps at which point a rubber band effect kicks in keeping the AI in formation behind me, too far back to apply any pressure but also out of reach of being lapped except during pit stops.  It is only at the highest AI skill level that opponents behave in a believable way.  The precision and consistency required at this level are more frustrating than fun for me, although I expect that some would enjoy it.  Configuring a race to include pit stops can make it more interesting, but also exposes more AI problems and deviations from the NASCAR rulebook. --- Of course, online multiplayer doesn't suffer from these AI issues and can be an incentive to hone your driving skills.  However, I experienced a lot of technical problems with online sessions if they had more than about half of the advertised 16 player limit. --- Posts on the developer's forum indicate they plan to release a patch to fix a number of the problems with the game.

A solid and deep multiplayer experience that people will be playing for years to come.Back in the day a small indie game called Counter Strike launched from a modded half life engine. The orignal game was filled with bugs and isses... but yet it grew to be one of the biggest and most popular online games to date.Right now Breach is looking fit to repeat that process. Most of the low reviews you see here are due to a bit of a rocky start for the game. A few teething problems for a very small number of people is unfortunate. However  - one week in and a patch is already out fixing many of the main issues.The online lobbies are crammed with players who are getting increasingly better at the game. Each round online is challenging and fun. The built in character upgrade system where exp earned ingame can be spent on new equipment is well balanced and highly addictive.My advice for anyone on the fence is to grab this game now while the skill level online is still not too high. Learn the ropes. Give the game time - as you need time to get good at this game - and it will certainly grow onto something that you cannot put down.The sniper class in this game is one of the most satisfying to play in any of the fps titles i have played in the last ten years.

It's not a fancy video game, but it is competent in what it does. You have four different types of puzzles to play: Sudoku, bridges, boxes, and museum. Sudoku - You know what this is. You make an arrangement of numbers, but so that none of them intersect with one another. Bridges - You have these ""islands"" with numbers on them, and you have to connect all the islands together, but you have to build a certain amount of bridges based on the numbers provided. Boxes - Another grid game. You have all these numbers on a grid, and you have to make boxes around the numbers. So, if it's ""4"" then you have to put four boxes around it, or connecting to it. Museum - Usig light bulbs, represented by green circles on a grid, you have to place light bulbs beside these numbers, and that creates light, and you have to fill the entire grid with light. Though these games sound a bit confusing the tutorial is well done, and will clear up any confusion. It's not perfect, but you can figure it out with gameplay. Also, this game is in 3D! The bottom screen is where the puzzle takes place, and is in 2D, but the top screen features graphics for each type of puzzle. Sudoku shows you pyramids. Bridges shows you the characters from Bomberman, who are on islands. Boxes has the Tron motorcycles. And museums is in a museum with what I can only describe as a blond dwarf. It's not much to look at, to be honest, but it does add to the game, and makes it more enjoyable. If you don't like these graphics you can switch them to something more plain, which will be a display of the puzzle, and a timer. You can blow on the mic to make it go from puzzle to timer, and vice-versa. And that's about it. This is pretty much a collection of puzzles. If you like puzzles you'll like this.

This could easily have been $14.99, and justifiably so. The amount of content present goes far beyond what's expected of a $5.99 throwaway title. This is definitely not a throwaway title. Aside from the different forms of Suguri, who all play fairly similarly, every character plays very uniquely, with their own strengths and weaknesses. As for what makes it unique, while the game does have a typical Hyper gauge that goes up depending on how many hits you get in or how many projectiles you absorb, it also has something called a Heat percentage. Normally, the Heat is at zero, and can go as high as 300%. The percentage Heat that you have is exactly how much extra damage you take from attacks; so if you have a percentage of 100, you will be given twice as much damage as normal. Heat is accumulated for the most part by dashing. Here's the thing: Dashing doesn't just get you out of the way of an attack. Dashing also leaves behind a trail of rings, which absorb enemy projectile attacks. When this happens, you absorb those projectiles into your Hyper gauge. Learning how to manage dashing and your Heat is critical to succeeding. This one particular mechanic is what differentiates this game from others of its type (of which there are few). It forces you to risk greatly lowering your defense to fill your Hyper gauge. Note that dashing also allows you to become invulnerable to some attacks, as does the Shield mechanic. Basically, all I'm saying is that this is one seriously complex game, and way more than what would be expected from a $5.99 fighting game with twelve anime characters, a handful of arenas, only a couple of modes, and some very nice bonuses in the form of story sequences for each major character (Sora, an unlockable character, has a very unique story sequence, and is the only sequence to be animated, despite being very short compared to the others). It's an excellent fighter, the characters all have personality and detailed backstory, the story modes are entertaining and humorous, the dialogue shifts from funny to shockingly macabre (Hae's backstory of being kidnapped and forced to stay in a dark room which she is not allowed to leave is stunningly heartrending, and was especially impacting and incredibly contrasting considering Saki's very lighthearted story involving pudding, cooking, and making people happy), and the game has a huge amount of personality with the cool fighting mechanics and flash to back it up. The added bonus story sequences are a great touch, and the two brief but entertaining story modes are also fun to play through. The bonus soundtrack provided, plus the theme and background, are very well done, and make that $5.99 even more worth it. For anyone with the slightest interest in fighters of this sort, especially those with a fan of manga-style characters and storylines, this is an obvious purchase. Mastering it is extremely difficult, and to learn the ins and outs of its mechanics takes time and practice. Just remember to read the wiki of this to have an idea of where to start. Great, great game. Just unreal value for the money.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/acceleration-of-suguri-x-edition

Sadly for many RPGs a love interest is just shoehorned in, a tacked on extra or a checkbox in the big list of stuff they think they have to include, so much so that many people think they're pointless or add nothing to the game or even detract from it. So when the Ar Tonelico series came along I was really excited to see a series that really went for it with the love story. Of course I'm several hundred RPGs on since I started and there's a lot of things I like in an RPG, good music, a well thought out world that feels alive and has a sense of culture, large swathes of character interaction, likeable characters, a battle system that is both fun and different etc. Thankfully Qoga succeeds in a number of these categories and excels in a few.As with the other games in the series, Ar Tonelico Qoga takes place in a tower above their inhospitable planet of Ar Ciel which has been covered by the sea of death. Unlike the other games where reyvateils were partners and lived among humans or below them, in this area reyvateils dominate over humans and carry out cleansings and purifications, either killing humans or enslaving them in the name of Clustania. The scale of the story is both massive in scope and minute in detail and is constantly balancing between intimate personal issues, large scale political movements and events with world changing consequences in a really satisfying way.Of course the story hinges on the two female leads, Saki and Finnel. They're reyvateils, a race of artificially created(though still biological) humanoids with the ability to use song magic. Saki is optimistic and innocent, Finnel is pessimistic and cynical, two fairly standard personality types, however when you begin to unfold the events that molded their personality they really become great, memorable characters. A further and unique level of complexity is added to them in the form of their personae. Both of them have a number of alternate personalities that govern aspects of their personalities. Sarapatra for example is a more mature, adult side of Saki. I can't talk too much more about them without spoiling some of the fantastic twists and turns of the story but you're left questioning if these personae are truly other sides of them or something else as they often work against their other sides desires.The other vanguard characters, Tatsumi and Hikari, took me by surprise with how great they were too. With such an emphasis on the romance between the hero and heroines you'd expect them to take a backstage and play a bit part, but no, they have their own story and goals which you help them to achieve while they help Aoto with his quest too. In fact in the early stages of the game Tatsumi is so preoccupied with pursuing his own agenda that he seems pretty cold and seems to be constantly looking for an opportunity to leave the group. He just cant ignore Aoto's troubles though and through the course of the game develops to be a really great friend.Even beyond the main cast, many of the NPCs have amazingly well thought out stories, some of them even tying back into plot threads through the previous two games in the series. I particularly enjoyed Mute, Akane and Richaryosha. Mute is a massive muscular melee fighter, completely railing against the regular idea of a reyvateil as a songstress summoner. Despite her role as an enemy early on and her fearsome appearance she's quite a sweetie at heart and can be oddly cute at times. Though still terrifying when running around shouting HONEY! DARLING! Akane too is an enemy to Aoto, but she's also Finnel's childhood friend. she's a cold hearted ruthless commander at first, but if you're a good enough friend to Finnel you might just end up being friends with Akane too.The crowning glory of the Ar Tonelico series is definitely it's hymmnos, songs that are sung in a language specially created for the games.  There are a couple of oddball tracks in there, particularly CUTYPUMP and EP=NOVA are strange tracks that I didn't like at first, but suit the characters really well. They hugely expanded the number of vocal artists working on this game and some of them are really great, KOKIA's tracks are beautiful. The rest of the soundtrack isn't quite as great and might be slightly disappointing to fans of the previous games but dont misunderstand, it's still a wonderful OST, better than almost everything else out there. It just had an unbelievable pedigree to live up to. Some of the slower tracks used in the more emotional and intimate scenes are really memorable soulful pieces.Overall out of the hundreds of RPGs I've played this will be one of those I really cherish, it's the only RPG so far this gen other than Valkyria Chronicles I feel is really a classic in the making.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/ar-tonelico-qoga-knell-of-ar-ciel

You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead. Another way to win is to gather your score and never burn it since at the end all score points are converted to time and is subtracted from your overall time and you may jump ahead the winner.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/ignite-2011

A parte da novela visual é como um negócio de escolha-sua-própria-aventura, com vários caminhos de diálogo completo com consequências permanentes - como a morte, se você escolher um caminho que leva você direto para ele. O jogo é * suposto * ter um monte de texto, eo que é mais importante é saber se o texto é ou não interessante - e é definitivamente, com sua maravilhosa equipa de localização fazendo outro trabalho fantástico, criar personagens individuais com personalidades credíveis . É um trabalho muito, muito bem escrito, longe de sua tarifa usual de videogame, e permanece consistentemente interessante e, honestamente, emocionalmente se movendo por toda parte. É realmente difícil fazer um jogo importado baseado em um monte de texto movendo emocionalmente, mas este jogo tem sucesso nisso em muitos aspectos. A parte RPG das coisas, que só acontece depois da aula é longo e você pode entrar na Arena, é lindamente original e uma alegria para experimentar. Veja, você não pode apenas power-level seu caminho através de cada semana e esperar para ganhar os duelos extremamente difíceis no final de cada semana. Você absolutamente precisa de informações sobre o seu oponente primeiro para que você possa talvez encontrar algum padrão, ou saber o que é particularmente eficaz contra eles. Sem conhecê-los, você não tem chance, já que é um dado que cada duelo é brutalmente implacável, e ser incapaz de prever as ações de seu oponente é a morte certa. Dito isto, o nível de sistema não é estático e permite que você escolha quais estatísticas para avançar, e você começa a usar até duas peças de ""desgaste formal"", ou seja, artes, que todos fazem coisas diferentes. É igualmente importante aproveitar ao máximo o seu equipamento e as habilidades que desbloquear. A linha inferior é que a audiência para este tipo de jogo terá que ""apenas um mais dia"" syndrome, devido a suas recompensas consistentes que tendem a aparecer no começo e / ou no fim de cada dia. Qualquer pessoa com qualquer apreço por uma novela visual / abordagem RPG vai adorar isso por sua localização excelente, intrigante árvores de diálogo, planejando sua semana antes do tempo, recolhendo informações sobre o seu adversário e um método muito mais estratégico de ganhar duelo cada semana com mais de Power-leveling.

After six hours deep into the storyline, I realized that Punch Time Explosion was not an attempt for the creators to make a quick buck. The game has great production value, great gameplay, and awesome wi-fi multiplayer (even though my roommates are better than me).We used to play a LOT of SSBB, and when we started playing Punch Time, it brought back some great memories. The game has a good range of characters that are nicely balanced. I actually like that the makers of the game followed some of the rules that Smash did. Your damage percentage goes up during a fight, which will make you fly farther off the arenas. The characters have Smash attacks that can be timed to do a lot of damage. I wish Smash was on 3DS, but since it's not, you can at least play Punch Time. It's easily the best smash fighter out there on 3DS.They definitely chose the best characters from Cartoon Network. Samurai Jack and the Powerpuff Girls are probably the best fighters, in my opinion. However, my roommates tend to use Dexter, Grim, Ben10, and Numbuh One the most. You'll have to play the game to find your best characters.The reason why I'm giving the game a 10, is because it's a brand new title on a brand new console, and offers quality art and gameplay. I was getting bored with playing Street Fighter, because I had already played it to death on 360. Of all the original titles for 3DS, this is the best one.",https://metacritic.com/game/3ds/cartoon-network-punch-time-explosion

While the latter provides a nice breakaway from Dance Central, this one again will provide variation on Kinect Adventures. Both new releases almost come close to leveling both their predecessors on par...almost.After having bought Carnival Games I was rather anxious to try the gameplay out at home, fearing I might have just wasted my money on a dud. I am happy to report though that I'm rather impressed with this game as it will definitely go down with family ""functions"" and game nights for everyone. This title definitely delivers on the Kinect experience.Gameplay - Carnival Games feature mini games, in fact 20 of them, which you can play single or with another. This was done pretty well and the second person can join very easily and opt out just as easily. My wife and I got this going for a while and were pretty impressed by the co-op ability.Games are similarly structured to that of Kinect Adventures. Menus are easy to navigate and not that complicated as other Kinect titles have proven.I don't have much negative feedback for this game, as I truly didn't expect a masterpiece. This is entertainment for everyone after all. My wife and I agreed that Wii will have to shape up on this front if it want's to keep the family from leaving their ""experience"", as we also have a Wii at home and since Kinect has come out we have not used the Wii for family entertainment again...a little sad though as it gave us hours of fun with Wii Resort and other titles. As long as Kinect regulates the release of these games to ensure they aren't all released at the same time, the market should not be saturated by ttiles such as Kinect Adventures and now Carnival Games soon. The only problem being that of quality as other titles have proven to lack recently.Overall, a good buy. For kids to enjoy, families to hang loose a little, and a crazy addition when the 'party' gets stale.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/carnival-games-monkey-see-monkey-do!

Most players will struggle to get even 50GS for beating it once as the achievements are very poorly written & do not give enough reward to players for beating the game. It should have given all the achievements for beating the game once! let alone without dying!!!5: Hazard animation timing is too severe/critical so this contributes to you dying a lot.6: Pixel perfect unresponsive controls. Such a shame as I can see no way this can be fixed or tweaked with any patching. Casual players will avoid as its too time consuming to replay the same section over & over for hours just because the game does not make it clear how you can progress. If it did not have these problems & was an easy to play/progress game with more checkpoints/gameplay options (there are no difficulty selections) then I would give it 10/10 its really a stunning looking atmopheric game which is faithful to the original HG Wells source material & without a doubt an alltime great 2D platformer if only it had enough QA testing these problems would have been ironed out before release. As it stands its a tragic release as the game promises so much but the unforgiving gameplay, poorly conceived checkpoints/achievements & unresponsive pixel perfect controls cause nothing but frustration to the player & add nothing to the experience only remove you from the game as you start to question why on earth they did not make the game much easier & more about experiencing the story/presentation instead of fighting against the poorly tested finished product.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/the-war-of-the-worlds

Let me start out by saying that The Jurassic Park: The Game is a GREAT game. It's actually one of the best games that I have played in recent years. I had been putting off buying this game because of the negative press that Telltale was getting (i.e., the ""Jeep"" incident and the metacritic allegation), but finally made the purchase on Steam along with Batman: Arkham City at 50% discount. Guess which one of these games I found myself coming back to again and again? Yes, I enjoyed playing JPTG even more so than Arkham City, which I felt was basically a rehash of the excellent first game. Now to the game itself. First off, to me this game is the epitome of cinematic storytelling done right in a video game. I can't say enough about how immersive the gaming experience was. I haven't played Heavy Rain or Uncharted series since I don't own a PS3 (although I did play Fahrenheit), so I can't compare the game to those established franchises known for superb storytelling, but as far as I am concerned, the plot, cinematography, music, and dialogue were all excellent. This was no doubt possible only through JPTG's heavy reliance on the ""quicktime"" game play, which I understand has a lot of detractors. However, after playing through the game, I think this type of gameplay was the best (and possibly only) way to tell this story effectively since the JP franchise is so synonymous with thrills and actions. I admit that some of these action sequences were quite challenging and I died a whole lot. But even some of the death sequences (i.e., getting eaten by dinos) were satisfying to watch. The interface also allows ""narrating"" the story from different perspectives at the same time, which was quite interesting and ingenious in my opinion. Some adventure purists may feel that the inability to move the characters directly restricting, but I personally didn't mind this at all. I played JPTG with my XBox 360 controller and I do highly recommend playing with one. I'd imagine doing those quick time sequences with a mouse/keyboard would be significantly less enjoyable somehow. The puzzles are extremely well designed. They are logical and realistic, and are seamlessly integrated into the plot. As such, the puzzles don't require cartoonish logic (No ""apply molasses to cat hair to make a fake mustache"" type of nonsensical puzzles) and often objects that behave realistically like their real-life counterparts. One of JPTG's strongest suits is its dialogue. The game overall is very well scripted. Although you won't mistake it for a Sorkin flick, the quality of writing is far better than some of the drabs you find in today's Hollywood blockbusters.  The characters are both varied and interesting. Each character has a back story, which gets developed slowly  throughout the game, and plays an important role to advance the overall plot. The story is face-paced and thrilling at some points and emotional and thought-provoking at others. The scientific tidbits that are introduced throughout the game are both interesting and consistent with the JP lore. One interesting thing that Telltale attempts to do in JPTG is to correct some of the scientific inaccuracies that were introduced in the original movie by explaining that the frog DNAs that were spliced into the dinos by Dr. Wu had introduced these ""anomalies"" in JP's dinosaurs. Now for the bad parts, which aren't that many. The most obvious one is its graphics, which is the biggest gripe that I have had with virtually all of Telltales' titles. It's definitely not top-of-the-line. But, then again, it is certainly ""serviceable."" The animation is quite fantastic in many areas actually. I don't know if they used motion-capturing technology, but the animations in a lot of the action sequences are top notch and the facial expressions are certainly good enough to covey the emotional depths. But the character models themselves lack the details and look ""plasticky"" under certain lighting conditions. The jungle, which is pretty much everywhere in this game, looks quite cheap if you look closely. The swaying grass and bushes are simply 2D textures moving side to side. That said, this is certainly the most graphically advanced game that Telltale has created so far. (I don't know if that's supposed to be a commendation or an indictment, but hey.) For those of you who are fans of adventure games, scientific fictions, or just dinosaurs in general, I highly recommend this game. For the Jurassic Park aficionados, JPTG is truly a worthy (and might I say ""essential"") addition to the beloved but aging franchise that is in sore need of its own ""resurrecting.""",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game

The reason why I took 2 marks from this game is because it is glitchy  sometimes when you hit a serve the opposing player just stands there and the ball stops in mid-aid and then comes hurtling back to you.

Never have I read so many reviews across the web and felt that so much wrong information was being published about this game. First of all, the game is hard, because that's the point. But you level up and get new gear and stay persistent, and soon those early enemies and bosses become fodder for your sword. The game demands patience from the player, but it moves along steadily (I'm about half way through at 30 hours or so, which is standard for an action RPG).Second, this game, though obviously heavily inspired by Monster Hunter, is quite different. It feels much more like a Square-Enix RPG, despite the fact that Square-Enix was the publisher, not the developer.Third, the graphics are really awesome. No, it's not the top of the stack for PSP games visually, but it is far prettier than most would lead you to believe.And possibly the most important point I can make: you can play this game solo. At least it hasn't given me a problem yet. Many complain that the lack of wireless connectivity doesn't allow you to conveniently play with others, but you can certainly play this game alone. I've been doing just fine...you just need to grind, loot, build new gear, level, and learn your enemies attack patterns.Overall, this is already going to be one of my favorite PSP games of 2011, so if you are on the fence, please by all means, pick this little gem up.

The game controls with the D-pad and shoulder buttons, which I assume is how all other B-A-M games control other than the DS version.  This would be great if it were all I knew, but it's not.  Knowing that there's a much more fun way to play was very deflating.  As far as the lack of multiplayer goes, that's a crime.

As far as features go, this game is seriously lacking.  There are two main game modes and some metals or something to collect for meeting certain criteria.  However, these metals do nothing.

Graphics - 8/10The graphics are good, not excellent but i couldn't find a fault with them.Sound - 8/10Men shouting, the clang of weapons, the smash of shields and screams of pain. It really emerges you and realisticGame play - 9/10Each mission has a character you play as and you sometimes get a small army of around 20-40 people following you to help, you can use special finisher moves on enemy's, different ones unique to each character. Its just fun =]AI - 9/10They arnt like other games where they sit and wait for you to attack, they attack randomly and the special enemies on hard are quite hard to kill at times with a army fighting around you. They dont all go after you nor do they all ignore you, its like a genuine war. Fighting all around youNormally when i get a game i trade it in pretty quick as soon as i get a little bored to get a brand new game for around Â£10. This game is joining my collection of never trade in, only which 5 other games are a part of. Its one of those games where your in a mood for fun, not graphics, not story (although the story is good) its just a game you can relax and play or have a challenge on harder difficulties. Also what i found unique is by completing the game on different difficulties you can unlock cheats, which i miss from older gen games.  Ignore ""professional"" critics. They just rave about generic titles from well known companies. This game proves that lesser known companies can produce gems. I just hope this game sells wonderfully to show the developer how amazing this game is.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/warriors-legends-of-troy

The camera is a bit shaky during intense battles. It's much longer than the way too short Fable games. Some media writers complain about the map because it's inadequate. Inadequate, it is, but I'm sure this complaint  comes from the same gun-crazy-give-me everything easy-violent-and -fast media writers that are not used to and do not want to explore and find things on their own.  To find things on your own can be quite enjoyable for an RPG player but it can be very frustrated to someone who just plays game to kill and run to get to the next level.  There's another thing I noticed, by reading critics from this game and from many other games in wich there is a female lead character, is that de facto those games rub the media critics the wrong way just because they use a female character, and, god forbid, she be sexy. I don't know why this is?  I believe part of it comes from an anti-Lara-Croft overexposure of girl-powers and part of it comes from male writers saying: a beautiful girl like that can't be that strong and female writers saying: a strong girl like that can't be that beautiful.

Prior to this game's release I had heard of the mechanic of customizing your own mutant and your powers. I had even heard that the story-line will change depending on what side you choose. Unfortunately this game not only failed to live to my expectations but it also left a bad taste in my mouth with really bad mechanics and repetitive game play. The story line follows the X-Men after the death of Charles Xavier as they try to fight off against an extremist group called the purifiers. You play as one of three stock characters and you can choose only one of three powers: energy beams, shadow manipulation, and body armor. None of the starter characters are compelling as they are really nothing more than mere stereotypes. The returning characters from the comics have a few moments to shine but they end up being nothing more than quest givers. The main plot itself even had potential but it failed to keep me invested since it doesn't go much in depth as it could have considering the complex-lore of the X-Men franchise. On the Wii cut-scenes are done through still images which looks bland and reeks of laziness in Silicon knight's part. The dialogue tree is tacted on at best and pointless at worst since no choice impacts the course of the story. Where this game really falls apart is in the basic design. The combat is highly repetitive and tedious as yo rely on pressing the ""A"" button on the Wii remote over and over again . Enemies drop like flies as you button mash your way to the top. The bosses don't fare that much better because you only rely on one strategy to beat them. The sequences are visually impressive but the actual mechanics are pretty simplified to the point that I might as well be playing ""Dragon's Lair"". The customizing hurts the experience instead of helping it since when you choose a power or suit, you are stuck with that suit or power for the rest of the game. There is no chance to test them before equipping so if you pick a customization you are not satisfied with than you are completely out of luck. On top of all of this, the game is ugly to look at with brown layed throughout the game with out of date character models. This game has a lot of potential but that potential has long been lost as it was rushed to meet a deadline instead of being made from the desire to make a good game.",https://metacritic.com/game/wii/x-men-destiny

If you're not a fan of NCIS, you might as well stop reading now and find something else to play, unless you already love detective games or pixel-hunt games like Mystery Case Files and Cate West. Otherwise, NCIS is a game made for its fans, featuring all of the major characters from the series (although few of them are actually voiced by their respective actors), and the game's case scenarios were written by the same people who script the TV show. And in case you haven't noticed, Ubisoft published the game to appeal to the same players as its CSI games, but NCIS actually improves in this area, as development was shifted from the Chinese company that handled CSI to an internal Ubisoft studio that would better understand the property. All-in-all, NCIS pulls off everything that it tries to do in a reasonable fashion. Analog controls are quite manageable, considering you have to move a cursor around to point characters in the right direction. The cases are relatively compelling, and some of the storytelling is genuinely interesting. Graphics won't knock your socks off, but they're functional. The sound matches many of the show's mainstays, from the ""thump"" sound with its black-and-white snapshot at the beginning of each scene, to the opening theme and other tracks pulled straight from the series. Gameplay is varied, allowing you to pixel-hunt for evidence, photograph crime scenes, move bodies, help with autopsies and other forensic analyses, and even interrogate suspects. That being said, the simplicity of each task, combined with a completion meter, make it impossible to mess up, and once the 5 hours of crime-solving is done, there is little reason to play again. On the flipside of this, if you're looking for some quick achievements, NCIS is a pretty easy way to get them, and the game retails for $39.99 instead of the usual $60. So, if you're a fan of the show and enjoy video games on a casual level, NCIS is a decent purchase. However, the most discerning NCIS fans and hardcore gamers will find a lot to b**** about here. As I have already mentioned, the characters are not voiced by their actors, aside from David McCallum for Ducky and Robert Wagner for DiNozzo's dad, neither of which perform as well as they do on TV. Ducky even comes off as seriously creepy without the support of NCIS's on-set chemistry. The character models don't always look great, either. DiNozzo looks nothing like Michael Weatherly, McGee and Ziva look good from some angles and bad from others, and Abby probably would've been okay if her body movements weren't so unbelieveably stiff. Gibbs fares the best in his appearance, but his voice and lines are so non-Harmon that it's annoying. Everything about the game could've been more ambitious, especially considering that NCIS is the highest rated scripted show on television and has climbed in viewership every year for nine seasons. CBS could've taken a paltry $10 million out of the show's multi-billion-dollar revenue and really contracted something special from Ubisoft, but instead, they made something that's only slightly better than the other games of its type. In that way, NCIS is a missed opportunity, but it will still hold some interest for casual fans of the show or of detective gaming. Could be worse...â",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/ncis

It may not be to everybody's taste but you can see that a lot of effort has been put into the art. It's  colourful, pretty unique and more importantly it fits perfectly with the general cartoonish atmosphere of the game. I really liked the fact that this game does not take itself seriously.You punch fratboys, you spank bankers, you punish corrupt cops and more generally you bring justice to white collar criminals.There again, it might not be for everyone's taste but personally, I really appreciated this effort. It's not so often that we have a game who is tongue-in-cheek and not afraid to be politically incorrect. It was especially true for the ending of the game which really  surprised me and reminded me of a silly version of Streets of Rage.Apart from that its a pretty standard beat'em up with a lot of action and some effort to make the levels as varied as possible. Good thing is, you can play in co-op with a friend on the same screen and use some pretty funny collaborative attacks. I must say however that II was disappointed the game  did not have some kind of XP system to unlock new moves as well as suffering from a few  glitches.It's good, funny and original but it could definitively be much better : 7/10",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/the-asskickers
