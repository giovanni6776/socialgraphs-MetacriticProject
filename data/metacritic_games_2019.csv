Playing as Tidus an athlete living in the metropolis of Zanarkand. You will witness your home being destroyed by an enormous mythical creature called Sin and then wake 1000 years in the future. Sin has terrorized the world of Spira in cycles ever since. Even once Sin is destroyed it eventually comes back, and the religious factions of Spira are convinced that the people’s indiscretions are largely the reason why. You join a pilgrimage with a summoner Yuna along with her guardians and friends to destroy Sin yet once again to bring peace to Spira once more. While Final Fantasy X-2 is a direct sequel it is set by a much lighter story in a freshly liberated Spira where you instead take on the role of Yuna. While it’s a very different game with a revamped combat system at your disposal, X-2 features a turn based combat system that runs in a ""real-time"" manner although you have the ability to slow the real time clock. Instead of seven characters, you control only three this time around. Customization instead comes in the form of ""dresspheres"", which are essentially 20 different classes you can swap amongst on the fly. You build loadouts of ""dresspheres"" using a system referred to as the garment grid, which offers plenty of flexibility during battle as long as you’ve planned accordingly for the variety of scenarios. Timing it right allows you to chain attacks for higher damage as well. Both are excellent remasters and well executed for the Xbox One. This collection will keep any Square Enix fan busy reliving the epic journeys at hand or enjoying them for the first time in their remastered glory. The price of admission is a little high however for these remasters compared to the other recent remasters made for Xbox fans, however as we have seen in the past Square is always good at offering sales on their games to allow for everyone to eventually add these little gems to their Xbox gaming libraries.

All the clues fit together, though, and all lead to the same place . . . when you're ready for them to do so. The clues left behind by long-dead alien visitors provide a glimpse into their lives and hopes and loves - and their disagreements as to how far their experiments should go - without ever being heavy-handed about it. In terms of story and game play, the 22-minute loop has a lot of appeal. Most of the time, it means you can be really relaxed about exploration, knowing there will always be another loop ahead of you. Sometimes, though, it gives you license to take outrageous risks in exploration, burning all your bridges behind you, confident that you'll be back at the launch pad at home soon enough. ---- Postscript: The thing about the controls is that this is one of the few space-based SF games that takes Newton's laws of motion seriously: you know, an object in motion remains in motion, and so on. If you hit one thruster, your ship starts moving in that direction . . . and keeps going in that direction unless you counteract it with another thruster. If you hold your finger on the button for a thruster, you will continue to accelerate in that direction. It also takes seriously the law of gravity: if you are near a planet, you will start accelerating toward that planet unless you counteract that acceleration with a thruster blast in the opposite direction. Most other SF games with a flying mechanic seem to assume that spaceships in a vacuum work just like airplanes in an atmosphere. They don't. So, yes, the controls in Outer Wilds take some getting used to, but they are manageable with practice. Also, the developers have included an autopilot and a velocity-matching mechanic that can help you out of tight spots . . . though sometimes you do have to abort the autopilot if it plots a course through the sun. There is no substitute for your own judgment in such situations.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/outer-wilds

Неужели так сложно довести до ума и дать любителям массовых застроек насладиться этим прекрасным жанром, управляя процессами джойстиком, а не клавиатурой с мышью? Вот поляки из 11 bit studios, как по мне, прекрасно справились с задачей переноса своего детища на приставки текущего поколения. Итак, о Frostpunk поподробнее. Наша главная миссия в игре выжить в условиях суровых морозов. Существуем мы в альтернативной реальности в 1886 году где солнце постепенно затухает и мир погружается в вечную зиму. Вокруг сердца города - огромного генератора, работающего на угле и соответственно согревающего людей и дающего тепло и энергию всем постройкам, возводим город. Видов ресурсов у нас немного - это уголь, древесина, сталь, сырая еда, пищевые пайки и паровые ядра. Главные для выживания ресурсы это конечно уголь для поддержания необходимого тепла и пищевые пайки, которые изготавливаются из сырой пищи, для того, чтобы наши горожане были всегда сыты. Прочие ресурсы необходимы для строительства всевозможных зданий, изучения новшеств и экспедиций. Помимо всего прочего необходимо следить за шкалой недовольства и надежды, каждая из них очень важна, так как в случае накопившегося недовольства или полностью угасшей надежды нас незамедлительно выставляют на мороз, после чего все придётся начинать сначала. Воздействуем на наших жителей прежде всего за счёт удовлетворения текущих нужд и принятия законов. Очень рекомендую начать играть для начала в бесконечном режиме, который не так суров к игроку и дает возможность понять все нюансы, ибо сюжетная часть весьма беспощадна и не терпит ошибок, исправить их будет очень сложно. В Frostpunk присутствуют четыре сценария: Новый дом - основная большая сюжетная ветка, Ковчеги, Беженцы и Падение Винтерхоума. Каждая история ставит перед нами свои задачи и в общем и целом они достаточно разные. Если в Новом доме мы с нуля отстраиваем город и готовимся к грандиозной буре, которую соответственно надо пережить. Хотя надо ещё до этой самой бури дожить, а это, скажу я вам, весьма и весьма непросто в виду постоянно валящихся проблем, с которыми едва успеваешь справляться как на очереди их уже вдвое больше. В кампании Ковчеги, к слову, самой миролюбивой к игроку, кажется это единственная кампания, где у меня никто не умер, нам необходимо поддерживать определенную температуру в трёх оранжереях, где хранятся чуть ли не последние на земле растения и семена. Это великолепный градостроительный симулятор со своей тяжелой и захватывающей историей. Бесповоротные рекомендации для тех кто понимает.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/frostpunk-console-edition

Buyer beware, however, that the game knows its niche and sticks extremely closely to it. Those who go in with the craving of maddeningly brain-busting puzzles will have something to satiate them for quite some time. Those who do not will find nothing of value here. For those interested by this premise, I would encourage to play the game, going in knowing as little else as possible, as a puzzle experience is easily compromised by spoilers. For anyone else, I share my thoughts about this experience. Let me start by saying that Baba is You is a game that is not afraid to go all-in for its niche audience -- a bold decision that I have nothing but respect for. The game wastes no time selling its premise, and defining what kind of experience it is going to be. It goes through its core concepts and removes the training wheels within less than an hour. Then, it keeps things fresh by introducing new rules and mechanics within those rules to learn and master. Puzzles are presented as single-screen levels, all of which can take less than a minute to execute, but most have the potential leave the player stumped for upwards of an hour. Puzzles themselves are designed with a mentality of problem-solving in mind. The player is encouraged to experiment, iterate and approach things scientifically. The more the player discovers about how the rules work and interact with each others, the more likely they will be to figure how to solve a puzzle quickly. Noteworthy, however, is that most puzzles aren't so strict as to have one, concrete-bound solution. This is especially true early on, and even results in each player approaching the midgame with entirely different cognitive toolkits. No two player is bound to have the same experience with the game -- something uncommon for a puzzle game, but nevertheless a welcome trend in the problem-solving subgenre. The graphics may seem amateurish and questionable, but to me there is no doubt that the Lo-Fi aesthetic is a perfect fit for such a game. Every token on the puzzle grid are represented in their simplest possible form - a shape, and a color. This makes levels easy to parse, regardless of how many things are moving, transforming, and happening. Had it not been this way, it would have been easy for it to cause an over-saturation of information that would distract from the challenge. The music also employs this minimalist philosophy, with each track using a small set of instruments. The compositions are quite brilliant and enchanting, but more importantly, they are easy on the ears and can be listened to for hours. Baba is You isn't a game for everyone -- far from it. But if you have a puzzle game itch to scratch, then this game is one I can recommend with all my heart.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/baba-is-you

In Blazing Chrome there are very few humans left. They are on the brink of extermination, and the world has been taking over by machine. Mavra a resistance fighter and Doyle a insurgent robot are their last chance of stopping the Machine Overlords from complete domination. This is one of my favorite modern retro games i'd say ever. They do an amazing job at capturing everything that was great about the Contra Franchise. They pretty much cover every one of the titles strong points, and even add a splash of another timeless classic Metal Slug.First let's talk about how it looks. JoyMasher has mastered the SNES and NES look. Every one of their titles look and feel like they belonged in that era. If you didn't know the library you'd think it was from that time period. If it was around in that time period it would have been a massive hit. I know I would have spent many a evenings going back and forth with this and Contra 3: Alien Wars. If you was that type of player, that enjoyed playing Coop games like Contra, Jackal, Ikari Warriors, etc with your buds this is certainly for you. Call them up, and get them over because ""Blazing Chrome"" will put you right back there in that feeling again. The action, the look , the feel just everything really emulates those classic games.Only thing may be a little different is the difficulty. Blazing Chrome has a easy mode where you have 7 men, but even with that you might find yourself playing some levels over to complete them. That is okay though, because more than likely your going to be playing this game over and over anyways. The replay value is so there with this one. You can even unlock new characters you will want to try as well. Easy mode gives you 7 men . Normal gives you 5, and Hard Mode i think 3 that one I'm not 100% sure on I never played it on Hard yet. I know I will though.The music and sounds are just out standing as well. It really sounds like it looks and feels. The music is just so rad, adds such a level of dramatic action to the game play. The sounds of guns and explosions just pulls you in. Everything about Blazing Chrome is just so spot on. Very easy to say top 5 best modern retro games this Gen of gaming. I know I will be playing it years and years to come as well. JoyMasher has got me hooked. They have moved in there along side Merge Games and WayForward as my favorite Publisher/Developer of Modern retro games this Generation of gaming. I hope to see more from them next Gen as well. I still need to check out Odallus: The Dark Call and really excited to do so. We haven't got a review copy yet, but they said they'd try to get one our way soon. Really look forward to covering it as well, if we don't hear from them soon I'm sure I'll be grabbing it anyways, and sharing my love of it with you guys as well.So is it for you? The answer is Yes, I don't have to come up with reasons why you'll love it, and how it matches your style of playing. You are just gonna love it any ways. Ya you might love it more if you were a fan of 80's and 90's action coop gaming, but I think most will love it any ways because it's just an overall quality game. Don't just take my word for it see other reviews. It's sitting there in the 8.5 and 9.0 range for most reviewers. Their only negative is the difficulty. I don't think the game should have to pay score wise though for lack of player's skills. I think it's actually a positive. I think it adds more to the game in the points of replay value, and just overall learning and appreciating the things you'd notice from grinding it out that you'd miss if you blew through it. So for me it's Modern Retro perfection, and my first 10 overall of the new Decade. Pros:Looks, Sounds, and Feels like Retro ClassicMusic is electrifyingAction PackedReplay ValueIncredible Robots and Robot BossesChallenging and ExcitingCOOP GOLDRETRO GOLD Cons:ZERO CONSZero, Zip, Zilch, None to be found. Overall: 10You won't find another game that captures everything that Contra brought to the table in the 80s and 90s. You won't find another game that brings that exciting feeling you had exploding the Alien heart with a Buddy back in in 1987. Blazing Chrome delivers. JoyMasher delivers again as well.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/blazing-chrome

To be honest, i'm not surprised about the quality, as those people at M2 are very passionate about their jobs, and every time they release a game, it shows and you can feel it. Lets dig in! Virtua Racing started the polygonal racing game craze. I know Atari had Hard Driving / Race Driving, but that game had such a low poly count and frame rate, it never actualy gave me a good sense of speed, and i still preferred the sprite scaling games above Atari's effort. When Sega released VR for the arcade, it really felt special due to the smooth frame rate (30 frames per second was really smooth for a polygon based racing game), tight game play with things that also can be found in simulation racers, like drafting, and improving your times by actually following a proper racing line. After a few reasonably good and a few just decent versions of VR, it's time to review this classic, and find out what's so special about it. Graphics: Somehow this art in polygonal racing games has still not lost its charm. The arcade may have a bit of pop in, due to the limit of the amount of polygons on screen, not so on this switch version. Here, the whole track has been loaded into memory, and is visible all the time, so no more pop in can be found. Combine this with a double frame rate (60 frames per second in single player game) and a much higher resolution (1080P) with no frame drops or other small things that might get you out of the flow. This game moves fast, smooth, and still delivers that adrenaline shot the arcade version gave you. Sound: Just as the arcade, there's not much of a full song in there, but at each checkpoint, you get a catchy jingle that changes every lap you drive. At a sertain moment, you will recognize the tune, and know what lap your in by just listening to those jingles. Also the passing car sound is rather meaty. The only small letdown (but that's because the arcade also sounded like this) is the engine sound. It has that ""vacuum cleaner"" feel to it that a lot of racing games suffers from. This does not distract you from the game, and to spice things up, M2 gave us a full song during a replay (your's, or one of the top leaderboards players) that came from the 32X version, but with instrument sounds that has the same quality as the arcade game, so it matches the game perfectly. Gameplay: M2 really gone above the call of duty and gives us 2 steering mode choices: Normal (Digital, like Virtua Racing on the Megadrive/Genesis), and Arcade (Analogue, feels like driving the original arcade game). Back in the times, i was really impressed with the Megadrive version, and i played that game so much, that the control grew on me. Now on the Switch, i play much better on the default setting (Normal, so digital input) than i do on Arcade mode. Thanks to giving us a choice, i am enjoying the game even more than i would have if they stuck with just one setting. But if you really want a chance to be with the top players in the leader board, you got to use the arcade mode, as the real pro players just are so much faster trough corners using arcade mode. Lastability: If you love improving on your times, and don't mind the game only having 3 tracks, just like the arcade, then you can have fun for as long as you enjoy a trip down memory lane with no consessions. It surely would have been nice if they included the Saturn or 32X tracks as an extra, but the price would have been higher, and their goal was to give us the definitive version of Virtua Racing, and they did manage to do that, and still deliver more than most developpers would give you. With modes like ""Helper mode on or off"" you can play with or without colision (turning the game into a real time trial, and also with colisions off your times won't be shared online) and there are hall of fames for each seperate mode (witch you see when you leave the game in ""demo mode""). For me, this game is one i return to once in a while just to have fun, just like with OutRun. This is a game from a time when Sega ruled the arcades, and now they do on the Switch. Does this mean this game has no flaws or small things that i would love to see changed in a update? Yes it has. I would love to see (just as in OutRun) a seperate dificulty setting for the amount of time you get, and also for the AI drivers. As now, even on the most easyest setting, if you're not a pro player, you are only able to finish the first track in 1st place, as the top 3 drivers on the medium and dificult track are super fast. You have to drive each lap flawless to have a chance of passing them. Also, when you enter a corner and use the acceleration off, and then acceleration on trick to slow down, the horizon jumps up and down every time you release and apply the gas. So with some corners, you really get a jarring horizon line because of this. So here's hoping for a update that fixes this.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/sega-ages-virtua-racing

On top of the fact that maps can be created and shared across PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. This game is also on PS4, but because of Sony's ruling, you cannot cross-play between the other consoles if you own it on that platform. GAME PLAY The game play is spectacular. It plays like Advance Wars but with a few differences. For example, instead of your commander issuing commands in the background, they actually fight with you on the battlefield and are pretty OP at that. You have to be careful though, if your commander dies, you lose. The map creator allows you to create skirmishes, campaigns, puzzle maps, and scenarios. Unlike other campaign editors, though, this game allows you to create your own cut scenes. SOUND The music is pretty good. I find myself repeating the melodies throughout battle. VISUALS The visuals are what you would expect from a Fire Emblem or Advance Wars game but to me, I find it scratching that nostalgic factor. Although, out of all of the good things this game has, I do however have a complaint here and there. You cannot save multiple games at the same time. You can exit and return to where you left off but that is it. This can be fixed in updates or mods in the future, though. You, also, cannot pick random AI or pick a difficulty for AI either for skirmishes. Again, this can be fixed in future updates or mods. Despite these couple of cons, I give this game a solid 9/10 or if I could, a 9.5/10.

We missed you. Hello everyone. It's me, Jayden Pickens. I have returned from my slumber and the first thing I played through was Trine 4. What an amazing game this is. Let's start at the beginning. Trine 4 returns to the 2d style of Trine 1 & 2. It's not in 3d like Trine 3. Storywise, Trine 4 takes place some years/months after Trine 3... that is a fact  proven by something in Trine 4, but I won't reveal where. That's for you to find out. We have a new story involving a prince whose nightmares are overtaking every place he visits. This time our heroes are summoned by the astral academy headmaster to take care of the problem. That's the story. I loved all the references to the previous adventures of our heroes. If you remember previous games, you'll have a smile on your face many times. When it comes to the gameplay, it's basically Trine 2 but with some new mechanics, I love the fairy rope and dream shield the most. With all of our abilities we can now solve most of the puzzles in many ways, not just one. You can also upgrade your heroes, but I've finished the game 100% without spending even a point. That means you can finish the entire game without upgrading anything... it will certainly make the game harder, but if you enjoy the challenge like me then go for it. I don't need to tell you about the graphics, because they're gorgeous as usual. Sounds are nice too. Overall, this game is a must for anyone who liked the previous games. It's my fav part of Trine right after Trine: Enchanted Edition for which I will always have a soft spot. If you have never played Trine before, that's not a deal breaker. You won't understand some references, but you won't be lost either. Go buy this stuff on gog, steam or whatever (but, I'd recommend gog, because you actually get to keep your game, not rent it).

It really is ridiculous. A 10 score should be reserved for a really great game. However, this is the very imperfect review system that we have to work with, and I don't want to penalize a great game just because I want to be realistic, when it's clear that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are not. Horace is something special. It has done something very different within the platforming genre. It's telling that I like this game so much when platforming games are one of my least favorite types of games. As a whole, I also do not like Indie games very much. There's just too much garbage being pumped out, and it has become trendy to call terrible Indie games ""amazing"", and refer to their crude graphics as ""gorgeous pixel art."". That having been said, Horace is definitely an exception, so I will break my rule about 10 scores to give it the credit it deserves. For an indie game that has low tech graphics, Horace does it really well. The graphics are colorful, varied, and overall, are probably more deserving of the description ""gorgeous pixel art"" than any other ""pixel art"" game that I can think of. My only grievance with the graphics is that when you are in close up scenes the graphics are so crude they almost hurt your eyes. This applies to all games with crude graphics, not just Horace. Unlike most other games with this type of graphics, when you're not close up, which, thankfully, is most of the time, the graphics are charming, and also unlike most games of this type, the graphics vary so that you really can't wait to see what the next set of screens will look like. The way Horace intertwines story and cut scenes in between the platforming levels, and even within the levels, is refreshing to say the least, and is very well done. It's virtually assured that what Horace has done in this genre will be copied in future platforming games, and may well help platforming games increase in popularity. The controls are not part of what makes Horace special. Fortunately, they are good enough that they don't really hurt the game. In more traditional platforming games that are so dependent on outstanding controls, it would be much more of a factor. This game isn't nonstop movement like most platformers. It's more slow paced and creative which I really like. When I first started playing the game in the instructional levels I was not too impressed with the controls. Fortunately, this is an Indie game that let's you remap the control configuration. If I had not been able to do so that might have killed the game for me before I even got started. So definitely wait until past the very beginning before forming an opinion. In addition to the ""gorgeous pixel art"", the music is great, and fits the game perfectly. It's not only good music but is constantly changing and altering the mood, which is a huge plus. Music is another aspect of Indie games that I think is very overrated. People just love to rave about music that doesn't seem to be that impressive at all. In this game it really is great. Finally, this game has so many fun references, and tips of the hat to other games. I think I will play again just to see if I can recognize all of them because there are a lot of them, and they sometimes pass very quickly. Maybe I'm wrong, but this game does not seem to be getting the recognition and accolades that it deserves. I hope this has been a successful venture for the publisher and or developer because it would be bad for gaming if a gem ( another overused word!) of a game like this wasn't successful. Hopefully it will generate more buzz now that it is free on Epic Games. Sadly, I would never have known about it, let alone bought the game, if I had not looked at it as a free game choice on Epic Games.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/horace

Прежде всего этот непонятный и провальный как по мне переход в 2,5D измерение, небольшой хронометраж игры, странная цветовая палитра картинки, а также не самая выдающаяся история, ещё и оборванная где-то посередине. Trine 3 мягко говоря не оправдал ожиданий и расстроил в большей степени. Четвёртая анонсированная часть в этом свете уже не выглядела чем-то, чего стоило ждать бессонными ночами, ибо продолжение экспериментов грозило и вовсе поставить крест на одной из знаковых франшиз нашего времени. Много ли вы знаете сочных современных платформеров, в которые можно поиграть вдвоём/втроём на одном диване и не пожалеть о потраченном времени? Первая часть была конечно сыровата, но идеи были очень интересные, вторая же развернулась во всей красе, и на сегодняшний день она является эталоном как всей серии Trine так и среди кооперативных диванных платформеров для большой компании. Trine 3, как мы уже с вами решили, была неудавшимся экспериментом, и вот четвертая глава приключений известной троицы на радость всем возвращается к тем самым мощным корням второй части. Игра получилась как и Trine 2 очень красочной, с контрастирующими разнообразными уровнями. Картинка в Trine 4 выглядит бесподобно, показалось лишь что художественное исполнение выглядит более академично и строже чем безбашенный взрыв красок в Trine 2. Новейшие приключения троицы стали чуть медленнее предыдущих творений Frozenbyte, ибо упор серьезный сделан в ней на головоломки, буквально с каждой сменой экрана нам предстоит поскрипеть мозгами: направить лучи хитрым образом, выстроив правильную последовательность отражающих поверхностей дабы открыть проход, или те же манипуляции, но только с водой чтобы пробудить растение и создание прочих мудреные и действительно занимательных алгоритмов. Для решения этих самых задач наших героев наделили новыми достаточно любопытными возможностями и механиками. Их немного, но они весьма дельные, а некоторые из них помимо своей практичности наводят развеселого хаоса — речь конечно же о прыгающих шарах Амадея, как-то неоднозначно звучит))) Сюжет... нуууу такой пресноватый получился, сделаем скидку на то что это сказка, хотя те же финны в предыдущих историях троицы, за исключением третьей части, интригу нагоняли будь здоров. В этот раз так себе, если честно. Не понравилось также однотипность и блеклость противостоящих нам мобов, им явно не хватило индивидуальности да и просто узнаваемости.

This is all it takes to realize that this game isn't going to make you let it off. In fact, you are going to have an unforgettable time. The cases are brilliant and amazing with tons of humor, thrill and overwhelming twists that will blow your mind. There are two main parts of the game. The invastigations and the trials. The invastigations weren't my favorite parts most of the times but the trials are phenomenal. About the humor trait of this game, there wasn't a time that 5 minutes passed without laughing. It's original, amazing and of the most important traits of this game. There were 3 cases specifically that will always be in my mind since they touch perfection. I was so overwhelmed and mind blows playing these. Not that the others aren't amazing of course,but those 3 are making you empathize and appreciate the characters way more. However, subjectivity is a huge factor in the matter, but trust me, not those 3.There is also another one who made me change opinion about another character completely, and now he one of my favorites.As for the rest  characters in general, they are all unique. Some good, some great, some unforgettable, some average, some bad. All personalities are there. I rarely emphasize with characters in games and this one is one of those that made me do just that. The dialogues are incredibly good written and the voice lines used in court are iconic. Also, the soundtrack is just amazing, as well as the incredible sprites and their animations. In conclusion, this game is almost perfect and you definitely should give it a try,even if you don't feel like being into this genre.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy

I played 4U nonstop, but was not a big fan of world. It did not hook me as much as the other games. But, Dauntless has filled World's place for me and I think it is fantastic. First, it have never been this easy to play a game with friends. It is free-to-play AND Cross-play. That means I can play with my friends who play on PC, while I play on PS4. Second, the weapons are fantastic. The axe is by far my favorite, since you literally become Thor. Third, I like the shorter hunts. They take only about 10 minutes, while Monster Hunter was about 30. It makes it so I can just jump in, do a couple hunts, and jump out. Issues: Since it is Free-to-Play, I found it fell victim to several mobile game tactics. Producing cells can take up to FORTY-EIGHT hours, that is **** Plus, it has a battle pass. It isn't BAD, but I've just never been a big fan of them. You are forced to grind for an unreasonable amount of time if you want the cool gear. If you paid for the battle pass, you shouldn't have to grind for what you already bought. Also, the performance at launch was awful. I play on  PS4 Pro and the game still chugged.

It very well may be the best visual novel I've ever played, in my opinion. I just wanted to make clear before I give my review that I have never played the original 2009 Steins;Gate game. Steins;Gate 0 came out about 6 years after that game. While I'm almost one hundred percent sure that, other than localization, the concept writing is obviously what takes up most of the development time for the Chiyomaru games, I will go ahead & criticize the art for this game. I know there are many hardcore S;G fans who religiously appreciate the designs from Huke, even to the point that some fans denounce the considerably well done anime & upgraded version of the first game I already mentioned, Steins;Gate Elite, done by White Fox. Unfortunately for S;G0, there were several times where there wasn't a sprite made at all for scenes, I even got tired of the character backdrops that got used instead of new sprites. While I enjoy the art Huke has done, I think it's horribly inexcusable that SO many sprites were reused from the original game. I'm not necessarily blaming Huke, here. However, it was clear despite never having played the original that many sprites got used from the 6-years-older original, which is incredibly sloppy to me. Normally this wouldn't really bother me... but the sprites that are updated with winter outfits look very different than the original sprites, so the reused ones look extremely bizarre to be included. This is even more apparent with how different the styles are when the setting is in summer again & you're seeing new characters next to the reused summer sprites. There were also many, many lines with the ""lip sync"" turned on that the mouth did not animate at all while characters were speaking. I'm unsure about if the time allotted for development was the issue, if it was money, or what, but I hate seeing such a high quality written visual novel look so clearly cheaply made. Which brings me to the positive notes I had: this was still a very good story with characters I love. The voice acting is excellent & the sound design, as expected, is incredible. The music is very well composed & makes for a great tone setting. I was surprised about the Switch port not having any changes made to the several mistakes in the script, but for how many lines there are, there really aren't that many discrepancies (other than with the RINE text messages, sometimes those didn't make sense at all). Also the auto scroll feature is in dire need of adjustment, even at max speed the non-voiced sections move about four times slower than the voiced dialogue. I don't know how the original S;G handled its multiple endings, but I do wish the flags for the choices diverging was much more clear, but it's very easy to just look up how to achieve all the endings without getting spoiled. I know it sounds like I was very down on this game, but I did enjoy my time with it. Hopefully the upcoming Steins;Gate 0 Elite will be on par with Steins;Gate Elite and remedy my issues with the art in particular.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/steinsgate-0

Then little subtle tweaks to certain stealth and combat mechanics that made it better.Nothing groundbreaking, and doesn't change it from being the fundamentally mediocre game it was (Black Flag was the one to properly implement that innovative changes in the series more properly), but nevertheless, visually improved and a mildly/moderately smoother gameplay .... otherwise its still one of (if not) the weakest games in the series....and we all know we're only tempted to go back to AC3 for the brutally satisfying Tomahawk combat lol.Youre better off replaying Black Flag, if any AC's after Ezio (where the series went down hill after, Black Flag aside)",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/assassins-creed-iii-remastered

Point-and-click adventures are great, Truberbrook even got my girlfriend to sit with me, and play along even in a 1 player affair we can share in the enjoyment. This along without overly complex problem solving we both felt at home because I often find games in this genre to contain a story that stays interesting from start to finish and Truberbrook definitely does contain a story that stays interesting throughout but this game does also feature a few setbacks along the way. Which may stop it from entering as the best games from within the genre will. Thankfully in the end it gets slightly more right than wrong and without a doubt something it gets extremely right is its art, and overall audio and visual presentation. This added immersiveness is a good save, because it helps offset a level of immersiveness that’s lost due to the game’s few issues we have already discussed. In terms of the gameplay this game features the usual point-and-click formula with plenty of fun and puzzles to solve during the story.

Серьезно, Дракот - один из лучших злодеев что я видел.Что же у нас во второй части? Все достаточно не плохо но первую, как по мне, переплюнуть не получилось.Основная часть истории без сомнений интереснее чем похищение сестры из первого котоквсета, и твист с  мне очень понравился, и даже подвязочка к продолжению хорошая, но... Антоганисты просто никакие. Да и протоганисты не сильно лучше. Не смотря на то что глав герои в отличии от первого котоквеста получили выражение эмоций, они.. менее живие чем протоганист первой части.. Во втором котоквесте все персонажи какие-то неживые, не выразительные.. вообще никакие. Кроме Хотто. Он просто шикарен. Лор:Опять же возвращаясь к первой части, там был ну прям оч интересный лор с долей недосказанности.. Навевает воспоминания о темных душах.

Мой СПГС ушел зимовать на юг. Я ожидал большего. Побочные квесты:Как и в первой (как вы уже поняли очень мною любимой) части в побочках прячется очень много отсылок. Но тут их в разы больше. И с одной стороны забавно и в определенной мере классно слышать перекаверканые, но так хорошо знакомые имена и названия, что прям душу греет. Но с другой стороны это губит восприятие игры. Это классно и забавно до определенного момента времени. Такого рода отсылки классные когда они идут в контексте чего-то но не являются этим контекстом. Когда отсылка делается ради отсылки это уже не то.Ведь гораздо приятнее понять отсылку в тонком контексте нежели когда тебе в лицо тыкают ""ВОТ ОТСЫЛКА, МЫ СДЕЛАЛИ ОТСЫЛКУ!!!""Бесспорно есть и хорошие, грамотно оставленные пасхалки, но далеко не все.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/cat-quest-ii-the-lupus-empire

Some of the pros and cons: - Very innovative concepts in the Grand Strategy genre such as aging, legacy, decadence and culture. It is one of the best ways I have seen that balances player expansion with internal stability. - Huge strategic difference and breath of experience. The nations are truly unique. Playing Sparta is very different from playing Gallic tribe or Carthage. The game not only has a lot of replayability as a result but it offers the player variety to fit their personal playstyle - Very complex systems that are relatively easy to comprehend (at least withing the genre) but hard to master. The various systems really play well together. The pop management, building management, trade, culture, decadence - it is all tied together and forms interesting system that gives player freedom of strategic choice. The game truly rewards good planning. - The combat system is very interesting. The game offers breadth of unit types - but mostly between cultures. The combat to me seems logical and balance of cavalry, skirmishers and infantry is usually the best approach to the combat. The combat offers some variety - as terrain is really important in the game and so are generals who have various perks and stats. - The last but not least is an option of exporting battles to Fields of Glory II. Now to be honest I am new to the franchise but I am loving the feature. By itself I think the FoGII probably captured the overall ancient warfare closest to what it has historically been. The battles are exciting and luck plays the role but it is also rewarding. Nevertheless the game does not require this addition - although I would strongly recommend to buy it in a bundle. - As a downside the game lacks tutorials and the online resources are spare so far - for sure compared to other titles in the genre. But there are some Let's plays around so I recommend you check them out to see for yourself if the game is for you. As a final words this is the game I was looking for for some time. It captures exciting period in the history and it really offers the player to forge their own story and leave their stamp on the world. Given the game just released and it will probably be patched and DLCs added it offers a lot of options that I believe will be enough for many hours of gameplay uncovering what devs brought to us.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/field-of-glory-empires

This immersive feeling is enhanced thanks to the very realistic and challenging gameplay which might I add gives you a great sense of achievement when you finally win a race, especially when challenging players online. Winning a race might take you a while though because the simulation present is challenging, so expect a few frustrating moments as you learn the ropes. When you do get the feel of the controls, it will make you appreciate the refined bike physics and it will also make you impressed with just how clever the AI is. MotoGP 19 has a lot for you to play, so expect it to consume a quality amount of your time. The overall content is very good but a few minor issues to deal with on occasion. None of these bugs are too problematic and I’m sure these will be easily fixed with a patch. MotoGP 19 is another step in the right direction for the series, it isn’t perfect but it gets so much right that you tend to forget about the little issues and instead all you end up focusing on the very realistic, competitive, and immersive racing.

It's really a complete package. You have eight stages. You have three characters to start and two to unlock. You have Hard Mode, which does not mess around. You have time attack with leaderboards. You have the choice of green or red. You have two extra versions of the soundtrack to unlock, from three different time periods of the series. It's only $20. The new sprite art looks absolutely excellent. Audio is great with some very fun updated soundtrack decisions, and a welcome return of the ""uagh, hurg, breek breek, fafafoom"" sound design that made Ninja Warriors: Again so satisfying (and some other audio that I won't spoil). Controls are 1:1 responsive, provided you have a low-latency television. Responsive controls are not so common these days. The ninjas all have new moves, further differentiating their already wildly different playstyles, and the enemies have some new surprises, too. I started my first playthrough with cautious optimism, and having completed a run, I can say the game is EXACTLY what an arcade brawler remake should be: fast, beautiful, and challenging. Enemy attacks and footwork are telegraphed just enough to allow No-Hit runs, but you'll be playing for awhile to achieve one! The AI is now very effective at seeking out and punishing careless mistakes, and enemy formations are demanding, so play well! I got stuck a few times on Normal -- enough to learn the boss patterns and remember how to play. Notably, the final level forced me to really memorize my attack ranges and delegate threat levels to different enemies, which I haven't had to do in a 2D beat-em-up for quite awhile. Every enemy could be the most dangerous one depending on the room setup, and I really like that. The last ten minutes of my first run began with a near-death rush through grenades and gunfire to grab a health pack, and the final boss fell after lots of concentration, to a clutch hit at 1 HP. I wouldn't have it any other way! If you like beat-em-ups AT ALL, get The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors. Seriously. It's one of the greats and it's worth having.

The addition of permadeth is difficult but handled well. I went into the game blind without knowing and had my favorite character die. I instantly force-quit the game hoping that my decisions aren’t saved before a cutscene ends but it was too late. Then my second and third characters died and i was forced to play as the last character left or restart the game. I considered restarting but chose to continue with the last character because I felt I was close to the end of the chapter. Playing as this last character was tense, worrying that hours of gameplay would be wasted heightened my sense of dread like no other horror game in recent years. I was able to finish the chapter, but walking through the house was more nerve-wracking than ever before. When I finished the chapter, it felt like an accomplishment. Making sure that I only made the most important decisions without leaving anything to chance, I was more cautious than ever before.This bled in to chapter 2 perfectly. I chose the same character this time around because he was expendable to me. But the more I played through the second chapter with him and the more he referenced his version of events from chapter 1, the more attached I grew. I now found myself, again, attached to a character going into a new chapter. The more progress I made, the more I worried that my time with him was almost up. When the game started throwing in random new mechanics I started to panic, worrying some mistake on my part would kill him off.There was even one stairwell that activated 3 unique, one-time-only effects at different times that made me feel like there were in-game flags placed at that location to scare me. These effects were new and had no accompanying tutorial text to solve them, but still required unique ways of escape while blocking usage of the map. I started going into the stairwell as prepared as possible, ready for anything. But whenever I was most prepared, nothing would happen. Each time I passed by, thinking that the game was done trying to scare me in the stairwell a new effect would come out or a previous effect would return. That’s about when I realized that the events were being triggered by an AI and that I couldn’t try to out-predict what would happen and where.By now I was playing as cautiously as possible. All of the haiku clues that I picked up in the first chapter came in handy and I avoided coming into contact with anything they mentioned. In a game where every character’s life matters, you need all the help you can get. Previous chapter’s collectibles can transition over to the next chapter to provide vital hints on what not to interact with, as some interactions can be fatal. These hints can absolutely save a character’s life if you can interpret them. Will you explore the area, putting yourself in danger to prevent a future death or take no chances? I ended up beating the second chapter with no deaths, still playing as my expendable character. When the chapter ended and I realized he had made it, he no longer felt expendable to me.As a huge fan of the original numbered Silent Hill series, Song of Horror made me feel like I was playing a classic survival horror game in every sense. Each chapter was just long enough to feel substantial, with the payoff being a sense of accomplishment and the desire to test my luck in the next chapter by playing the same character.I do have to get out of the way that the voice acting was fairly weak overall, with Daniel’s VA sounding the most grating to me. Most of the other characters were passable enough. Honestly, I think too many professional VAs might have lessened the impact of playing as an everyman. The story is serviceable enough to move you forward, with a fair amount of backstory coming from the items you inspect and the characters you play as. For an indie horror I was really impressed by the attention to detail. There were a few times that I saw creatures or ghosts in windows or across hallways that made backtracking feel more personal and less of a chore.I saw the rating on Steam and Metacritic and felt that Song of Horror deserved a higher rating so I thought I’d pitch in. Personally, it may be one of my new favorite horror games. It’s unique and fresh while providing a moderate burn without fatiguing you. The random elements of the game’s AI ended up giving me some pretty memorable moments that I don’t think I’ll experience again.I’m very excited to play the next chapters and I hope that this game gets more attention. By the time March comes around and the game ends, I know I’ll be craving a sequel.[Played on PC in 4K with SuperXFI amp, Sennheiser HD6XX’s and Philips Hue sync lights]If you want the best experience, recommend playing in 4K with surround-sound headphones.

I was hooked from the start and constantly impressed by every aspect of the game. The random nature of leveling up and gaining new skills was fresh and was never a problem for me. Admittedly, I wasn’t sure at first if I’d like it, but I quickly grew to love it and stat increases and new skills came frequently enough for me to begin to prefer this system. On top of that, the option to choose your parties combat formation added an extra layer of depth to strategy that I absolutely loved. This game literally made me, for the first time, appreciate using characters whose primary roles and weapons were shields and defending. Additionally, the combat and grinding could be sped up and was never an issue.There’s several difficulty spikes throughout and the lack of voice acting was admittedly strange during cutscenes — definitely felt lacking. But the OST, gorgeous art work and character design, and emotional and interesting story more than made up for that. I loved this game.

Il y avait une promo sur le jeu et par curiosité et vu les très bons retour sur Steam, je me suis laissé tenter et je suis pas déçu. Le petit plus qui fait plaisir c'est que c'est un jeu français.C'est un très bon petit jeu de gestion et simulation de ....... bah d'école de sorcier.Alors c'est pas un gros jeu de gestion/simulation avec 40 000 options et possibilité, mais l'idée est originale, efficace et bien penser. On retrouve la magie de la Nature, Alchimie, Ombre, Lumière, Arcane.On construit son école de sorcier en récupérant des cartes que l'on gagne en dépensant de l'argent ou de la magie voir lors de quête. Et chaque carte de construction offre une classe ou une pièce spécifique que l'on empile dans un espace défini où l'on doit disposer ses pièces et classes comme on souhaite selon les connexions qu'offre chaque pièce. Il existe environ 5-6 classes différentes par type de magie. Par exemple pour la Magie de Lumière une classe d'héroïsme, une autre de Vindicte etc.... Et dans chaque classe il faut recruter un professeur. Il existe d'autres cartes de pièces qui sont par exemple une salle de réfectoire, une salle de dortoir, de salles des professeurs et d'autres... Chaque pièces à son importance et permet de faire évoluer les élèves vert un avenir particulier où à la fin de leur formation on aura à choisir leur avenir ou leur métier.Chaque début de trimestre on reçoit des propositions d'élèves que l'on peut accepter ou pas dans notre école, car élèves qui demandes à étudier dans notre école ont parfois des trait négatifs qui peut aller mauvais élève à agressif ou perturbateur etc qui peuvent poser problème dans l'école en faisant des bêtises par exemple. Et certains sont pauvres mais vous avez besoin d'argent pour faire tourner votre école et payer les prof etc... donc faut t-il les prendre alors qu'il ne pourront pas payer les repas ni les dortoir, mais vous pouvez mettre les dortoirs et réfectoire gratuit mais donc de l'argent en moins qui rentre... bon c'est pas bien compliquer non plus à gérer.Ensuite il y a les carte pour avoir des objets que l'on met dans des emplacement spécifique qu'offre chaque pièce et classes, objets qui permettent d'améliorer l'apprentissage, améliorer l'ambiance, offrir des bonus etc...D'autre carte sont des bonus direct aux étudiants ou des potions etc...Il y a une carte où il existe différentes factions avec qui vous devrez vous devrez améliorer vos rapports en faisant des cadeaux ou des quêtes ce qui aura pour effet de vous offrir des bonus selon les factions en augmentant votre pourcentage de bin rapport, à l'inverse si vous avez de mauvais rapport, vous aurez des malus. Sur cette carte il y a des donjons qui apparaissent de temps en temps où l'on peut mener des expéditions en choisissant 4 étudiants. On y récupère des cartes, de l'or ou des points de magie.La campagne ce finit en quelques heures et à chaque mission de la campagne on a le Mal qui avance et on doit donc jusqu'à son arrivé, finir de former les étudiants et faire les objectifs demander pendant la mission.Ca reste un petit jeu indé donc faut pas trop en demander sur le contenu et la durée, mais le jeu compense parfaitement par son originalité et le fait que l'on peut y jouer en faisant de petite partie de temps en temps par exemple.C'est un 9 car je note en fonction de ce que le jeu propose, que c'est le premier jeu du studio, que c'est indé et qu'ils ont quand fait quelques chose d'original et j'espère que ça fera venir du monde sur leur jeu et que ça leur apporte un peu de fond pour des jeux plus ambitieux.Si vous aimez ce genre de jeu, prenez le il vaut le coup et en plus ça fera un peu d'argent pour un petit studio français qui à fait quelques chose d'original et de bien.

Classic dungeon crawlers are pretty rare nowadays and on consoles the situation is even worse. So I took my adventure within Vaporum and its steampunk-ish world of attacking robots, deadly traps, harsh puzzles and amazing artstyle. I rated this 8.5 and finally gave it a 9 in here but 8 would be also considerable. First of all the game ran perfectly smooth on my PS4 Pro SSD. No hiccups, no slowdowns, no bluescreens, no loading issues (2-6 seconds per load or area swap). The engine itself provides an amazing artwork quality with nice special effects. The developers did an outstanding work by capturing the heart of steampunk and putting it in a scenario that reminded me a little bit of oldschool horror movies like Cube. The atmosphere overall is spectacular and provides a dense feeling with some nasty surprises here and there. The sound is pumping and delivers a supreme feeling to the good base quality of the game but could use a little more variety. Controls have been critized by a lot of people but I do not really see why that would be a point. This game is grid based and you move via stick or cursor taps to the left, right, back or front. Actionable pieces are shown when you trigger the shoulder button and the cursor is already snapped in position. Some menuing could be optimized but in my opinion there is absolutely nothing to worry when it comes to console controls, something that is for myself really important. The story is interesting and will develop as you wander deeper and deeper through the dungeons by textbooks or voice tapes that are found by the player. I mostly click these away but I enjoyed it quite a lot in Vaporum. The voice acting is very good. Character development follows different mixable possibilities from dual wielder, to gunman or mage-like types. Level points are a bit scarce in my opinion. In ended up with level 15 at the end which means 2 of maybe 8 (or even 10?) talent trees can be completely maxed and one by half. I read somwhere that 16 is actually max but I m not 100% sure of that. Puzzles are sometimes a bit hard, depends on how good you are with these types of stuff. Enemies vary a lot and are interestingly matched to weapon types or magic, providing a decent paper-stone-scissors principle. I was unsure whether to give it 7, 8 or even 9 points. The game has some flaws and is in my opinion really hard at times depending on your playstyle and chacter build. The final fight and some rooms are considerably hard. You find ammo and health packs but I feel that a casual player on normal will probably run into problems here. Some backtracking passages I didnt like either which is why I reduced the score in general by 2 points but I really think this game deservs around 8.5 After all Vaporum is a considerably well made dungeon crawler that provides an outstanding steampunk-ish horror-esque experience that is worthwhile for 6 to 15hrs depending on playstyle and experience. Vaporum Lockdown will hopefully feature some more variety and game length but keep on with what they did well on this one. I would definitely buy this one again but would advise to wait for a decent sale.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/vaporum

Despite the voice acting being a little lacklustre at times (or not present), I found the presentation side of the game to be very impressive and most important of all throwback to long time favorites with an extended journey and easy to manage inventory system and skill tree. All in all the Warhammer franchise is fantastic, it has a long history of varied game play. To say then that I was looking forward to Warhammer: Chaosbane would be quite the understatement and being a fan of the series earlier mentioned I was excited and found a very enthralling experience in the end. The entertainment was experienced almost immediately as I plugged head first into battle looting and hunting for better gear with each drop. The customization of combat elements and the skills you can upgrade provides a huge amount of customization you can change on the fly and even the same class of character can feel very different from the decisions you make in their abilities. Using your abilities when in combat is always fun as well because there is a decent amount of varied enemies for you to face around every corner. The boss battles are great and defeating them was so rewarding especially when cranking up the difficulty. In terms of problems the game has a few that aren’t too bothersome but there is an issue that disappointed me a little and that is the number of times I had to revisit certain areas within a new mission. Warhammer: Chaosbane tickled my fancy despite it could have been better in a few areas. I'm looking forward to the additional content coming in the season pass and how in depth the evolution of the game will take us.

Once you've played (and likely died) a few times, you quickly realize that one mistake, or oversight could be your end. Game play itself is straight forward, You need people, and energy to run everything, while keeping everyone fed, and gathering the materials you need to build more, and researching better buildings, and keeping a stock of soldiers for your defensive lines. Just like any good RTS you can easily under-produce nearly anything, keeping you from making the next great structure, so be sure to try and keep everything just above ""What you need"" and you'll be a bit better off. The slim choices in units and proceduraly generated maps can make early game a bit harsh, especially for newer players.

This is everything that gaming should be. It's an ode to real time strategy and military simulation that respects your intelligence as a gamer. It feels like a labour of love, like how people used to make games before. You can feel that for these guys, the game they made is not only a career, but also something special, something that will leave its mark, something that will be remembered, something that they would have loved to see on the market and play it themselves. I honestly think this is the best, optimal concession that can ever be made between realism and fun, more realistic than that and it wouldn't be fun, and more arcady than this and it wouldn't be a wargame simulator. I think there is no other RTS game like this one. This is as close as you'll ever get to the historical authenticy and source material while still having an actual fun and deep tactical strategy game. Even the ""arcady"" elements the game has, such as the ""signature"" Eugen deck-building (which is even better now with phase-selection) mechanic where you build your own division, customized to what strategy you have in mind and yet limited and balanced by the historical limitations of the division you're using, is itself a ""realistic"" abstraction, and is super fun. It appeals to my desire of creativity. I love coming up with crazy builds such as having an opening with veteran Luchs german light tanks and being rewarded with an early lead in the game. Does it have flaws? Yes. I think it takes a little bit of time to get used to for sure. You should play a few games vs Easy AI. But, at the same time, with the amount of experience they have in the genre now, with the experience they have from past games, it is clear that this one has achieved something special as it has probably the best UI of all of them (which isn't a feat since all past games had terrible UI lol), and is probably the easiest out of them all to get into and to start playing. At least you should try playing it, not to mention that it's one of these games that is super fun even on PvE especially if you play with friends. This is a reference, the ""Total War"" of WWII strategy games, a pillar of gaming that we will look back to in the future (and play) with fond memories. Thanks Eugen.

I've also not played in 2 player mode, so I don't know how that works either. This is one game you won't want to pass up. If you found this review helpful, please leave a thumbs up.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/lego-jurassic-world

Your quest will take you through more than 50 caves, dungeons and towns, each filled with monsters to defeat and puzzles to solve. You can stock your traveling party with three companions from nine character classes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses.U.S. gamers got their first taste of Dragon Warrior III in 1992, when the game was released for the original Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was massive even for a home console system, and Enix has upped the ante even more with the Game Boy Color version. Revamped graphics make the game look better than ever, new twists to the storyline keep things fresh, and plenty of other changes help to give the adventure a rejuvenated feel.One of the most intriguing changes is the addition of a personality system. You're asked a series of questions when the game begins, and you are assigned a unique personality depending on your responses. There are over two dozen possible personality traits, and the game changes depending on your character's personality and gender. If you don't like the way you've been labeled, you can always read a book or two to alter your personality.Monster Medals are another new feature in the Game Boy Color version. Monster Medals are sometimes left behind after you defeat an enemy, and come in three varieties: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Using a Game Boy Game Link Cable, you can trade Monster Medals with your friends to try to complete your collection.There are over 150 different monsters to strike down throughout the game, including some new monsters like SeaSlime.

It is a game that you need to experience for yourself. Also, this is not a game for everyone. To fully enjoy you need to have in mind that this is a game very different than any other game out there.To enjoy it you need to have patience, to pay attention to every detail, to take your time, and to play it more than once. Just as the name says, the experience is made by more than one layer, and the more times you play it more you discover and it makes more sense. The first time I finished this game I felt a bit disappointed. That's because this time Bloober was more ambitious and experimented a major variety of ambiences and a even more abstract aproach to the storytelling. But then I just took some time to think about the game and writed down some ideas about what I saw in it. I created some theories. And this was the part when the fun began. I felt like the game was finally taking form in my mind.Then I started to play a second time and every detail was making way more sense this time. That was the point when I felt that this really was something that came out from Bloober Team's minds. Now I am loving the game just as I loved the first one. I already started my 3rd playthrough as I said before, and I am really enjoying the game a lot more than when I played it for the first time. So my advice is: - This is not a game for everyone.- This is not totally equal to the first one, so take your time to put the pieces of the story together and play more than once.- Don't be so hard on trying to figure out everything on the story. There's no right or wrong version. That's the beauty of it. The truth is what you believe it is and what makes more sense to YOU. Thank you for reading.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/layers-of-fear-2

Later, I came to a point where trying to enter the next level causes a crash of the game, making progress impossible. Currently hoping for a reply on reddit, then I'll try the devs. It is occasionally frustrating when getting stuck between two checkpoints, at which point it really helps, that the Switch lends itself to short sessions, that can be paused indefinitely at any time. With the PC-version I probably would have tried to play in longer sessions, would have gotten frustrated, and given up on the game. When really stuck, or if you want parkour without (with less) dying, the ""Assist Mode"" allows significantly lowering difficulty: Continuing the level at the farthest checkpoint (not relevant on the Switch?), lowering the speed of the game, longer gliding, invulnerability to the thorns in the levels or multiple hits before dying from them are some of the options. At least on the Switch I didn't notice any bugs or issues with the controls as reported by user krzysiu99 one year ago.

We had no idea what to expect, but the stylish voxel look of the game appealed to us, and so we gave it a try. What a pleasant surprise! In a word, the game is just fun. Riverbond is basically a dungeon crawler that supports 1-4 players. There are 8 quests in total, and each is divided into 5 or 6 smaller pieces with a basic task to complete in each and a boss at the end. Along the way, there are skins to unlock and new weapons to find. Pretty basic stuff. But while the structure is fairly standard, it's style & whimsy sets Riverbond apart. For starters, the environments are brilliantly crafted and are a joy to explore and ultimately, to destroy. Plants, buildings and furniture all explode in a shower of voxels, an effect that never got old, especially when you defeat an end boss. Beyond the cosmetics, a wonderful & quirky sense of humor envelopes the whole game. From the skins that you unlock, to the unique weapons (squid on a stick!) in each level, to the dialog with the characters you speak to along the way, Riverbond is playful and whimsical throughout. Combat is easy to pick up. Each character is identical in terms of their playability, but you can customize your attack style with different weapons that you find. The combat system is designed to be fast & fun, rather than super-challenging. There are certainly enemies that are harder to defeat than others, but you can easily get by defeating weaker enemies by mashing your melee weapon, and tougher enemies & bosses can be dispatched with a combination of a projectile weapon and some well-timed dodging. The low difficulty curve makes Riverbond very accessible, however, and it's an easy game to pick up with a friend (or daughter, in my case) for a few hours of dungeon romping. Any criticisms I have are minor. There is not a lot of variety in enemy styles. End bosses all basically play the same way, and lower level baddies follow the same general patterns on each level. It's also a very quick playthrough (4-5 hours) without much incentive to replay. Even having some high score boards, or end-game challenges would be nice additions. But those are minor quibbles. This is a FUN, gorgeous game, and well worth a few hours of anyone's time.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/riverbond

The story is pretty good. The combat is what you'd expect. The RPG elements are pretty weak given that it is a short game. The biggest complaints I have against this game are the achievements and the puzzles. The puzzles in most cases are pretty straightforward to figure out. But there are a couple that are completely guess based such that you really wouldn't have any way to figure them out logically. What's worse is that some folks asked in the forums about it and the devs said they too discussed whether it was a bad puzzle but left it in anyway. So the devs knew a couple of the puzzles were not great but they decided not to change them. The same thing with a couple of the achievements. There are 2 that are basically impossible to get and a couple more are highly unlikely because they are RND based and the chances plummet each time. Again the devs were asked and they responded with ""that is why they are achievements"". Yet if you look at the % completed for the cheevos it's really low. Clearly there is a problem. But perhaps the most frustrating achievements are the ""complete in 90 mins"" and ""don't take X dmg on the hardest difficult"". Nobody on all of XBox has unlocked them. Nobody. When asked about it by the devs they admitted that only 1 person on the entire team had ever done it and they were someone who played it over and over again and they barely did it. So the devs purposefully put in an achievement that is pretty much impossible to get. They said they'd adjust it if it proved too difficult and they never did. When game devs build a game and don't listen to feedback I have a hard time giving them my money in the future. Overall a reasonable game for the money but questionable decisions by the devs makes me reconsider whether I will purchase another of their games or not.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/vaporum

At the core this game is a puzzle game with platform elements combined and thankfully, the puzzles have been done well overall. The puzzles have been done well enough that I was prepared to look past the lack of difficulty and focused solely on the creativity within each of the puzzles. The environments had a ton of creativity and this meant exploration rarely got dull, all thought it was a nit cumbersome when I had to backtrack a few times during my play through. Degrees of Separation gets another nod, because everything runs smoothly and each mechanic is worthwhile and doesn’t hold the game back. I do have a couple of complaints though, as it isn’t a perfect experience but I could look past the lack of depth in the story and the backtracking because everything else is done well.

There’s a load of content for you to play, and the variety within the content means racing your bike never seems to get dull or bland.I enjoy the amount of customization options that are available, because being allowed to chop and change certain things meant I could put my own personal feel on things.  Technically the game holds up really well throughout and this meant racing around on my bike always felt fun and most important of all realistic. The riding and physics of the bikes feel improved over the original game and winning a race now feels a lot more rewarding because of this. I found the load times to be a little too long and waiting around can test your patience.  Last year’s Monster Energy Supercross is definitely up there with the best bike racing games ever. I went into Monster Energy Supercross 2 with excitement and a touch of expectations as well. Thankfully it delivered, because this game has took what was so good from the first game and in some ways improved further which in turn made this game absolutely brilliant. One of the improvements then came in the form of the riding itself because the physics feel more realistic this time around. You can also chop and change more things this time around as well and this added touch was nice because the freedom allowed me to make things more personal. In terms of content the game has a myriad of modes for you to get to grips with and racing in each of these modes never became dull or boring. The long load times in Monster Energy Supercross 2 aside, gets little else wrong and with the added bonus of an exciting, hyped, presentation and a technical essence that doesn’t throw many problems your way. You get another offering that’s stands up there with the very best motor bike racing games of all time.

The original Layers of Fear I extremely enjoyed because it managed to scare me on multiple occasions. I was eager to play the sequel Layers of Fear 2, and as far as sequels go sometimes they fail to deliver a similar experience and sometimes they succeed. Layers of Fear 2 is greatly enhanced over the previous game, and an overall better game in all aspects. These enhancements were noticeable immediately as the immersion felt much more refined and the twisted nature of the game for me as a fan of the genre. Some players may find mild frustration from dying a few times, although I enjoy a challenge and thanks to the story I assure you that you will press on. There’s much more depth this time around, and when you factor in the puzzles that you come across you find yourself getting a strong sense of of immersion from Layers of Fear 2. If you’re looking for a game that enjoys to mess with your mind at every turn then you’ll thoroughly enjoy what Layers of Fear 2 has to offer. Recommending this game to you is very easy because as far as the horror genre goes this is a very good addition to the Xbox One family of consoles.

I really enjoyed the combat elements that were present in the game and I must admit that I didn’t expect the combat to have as much depth as it had. It mixes together a number of different genre’s and for the most part these different genre’s combine together extremely well. There’s a decent variety of cards you can use when swapping and changing your deck and this keeps things fresh and interesting for longer than one might expect. The game suffers with a few technical issues every now as do most games at times along the way. Not much offered in the way of a tutorial and the lack of depth here does cause a few learning curves along the way. The difficulty curve to be a problem at times because out of nowhere it can become unforgiving which could cause frustration for those looking for a more laid back experience. I’ve been waiting for Absolver to make its way to the Xbox One. That’s mainly because I love game’s that mesh different genre’s mashed together. Thankfully the different genre’s mesh together really well and this does create an enjoyable experience within the game, however the game is far from perfect. Unfortunately the game does suffer with a few technical issues every now and then and while none of these are major they can have an overall impact at times. The difficulty curve in the game can also be a problem as well but I advise that you look past this because when in full flow you realise quite quickly that the combat elements in the game have a lot of depth within them. Another aspect where the gameplay has depth is in regards to the deck building mechanics and without a doubt trying each card is fun and definitely makes things stay fresh and interesting for longer. I just wish certain aspects were explained a little more though because it can be confusing at times. At the end of the day then whilst Absolver definitely gets more right than it gets wrong and the uniqueness that’s present in certain areas does keep you coming back for more time and time again which means it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me.

This is a completely different beast from Grid however. It is accessible enough to novice gamers, or those with little to no interest in rallying, but high difficulty could put some off. In terms of content, to my personal knowledge, the is the same full-fat game as is on the competing consoles. The only major draw-back, to be expected, is the visuals. The game is still capped at 30fps, the same as PS4 and X-One, but as you can imagine, graphics have been paired back....A LOT. The game looks serviceable enough, though I do get the impression they could have pushed the visual aesthetic just a little bit more without sacrificing frame-rate. But hey, its early days, and we live in the days of post launch patches, so we will just have to wait and see. Saying that, car models look great, the lighting is better than expected, and weather, terrain, and environmental damage effects do look the part to be fair. As a rallying experience, this is surely in the top of its class. There are plenty of modes, with plenty of customisation options, and a hefty amount of tracks across various locales with equally various weather conditions. On the controls side of things, I haven't noticed any form of motion control input, but then again, I can't see how it would work well here unless you had a dedicated steering wheel accessory. Pro controller at least works a dream and the cars feel nice and weighty in response. Overall, if you were able to stomach the visual downgrade in the switch ports of games like Doom, Wolfenstein II, and the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, then you likely won't be that affected much by this port. Behind the screen of flat, low-poly environmental textures and almost non-existent anti-aliasing lies a superb rallying experience that offers hours-upon-hours of enjoyment. Graphics: 5/10Gameplay: 9/10Controls: 8.5/10Audio: 8/10Lasting Appeal: 8.5/10.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/wrc-8-fia-world-rally-championship

The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. Key Features: * Survive Together Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? * Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so youll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. * A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killers unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. * Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. * Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how its going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience.

When the player enters a room they may be “locked in”, this is where they are will face waves of enemies that will attack the player, once all enemies have been defeated the player may then progress.The combat system utilizes a mixture of three types attack, a special skill, powerful time bending abilities and a mechanic called flash, a dash skill that allows the player to avoid attacks with each use having to cool down. Each of the three characters can upgrade their skills using orbs collected from defeated enemies, completing missions and as rewards, the orbs can also be used to purchase items in the shop, unlock relics and level up character stats.Speaking of items and relics, the items that the player can use include potions, temporary boosts and exploration aids, the relics offer stat boosts that can be set into custom loadouts for each player, the stat boosts can be used to either increase a characters strengths or offset a characters weaknesses, this gives an additional level of depth to the way the player can customize their experience to fit their own play style.Since the game uses a metroidvania approach to the progression of the story there are points throughout the world where the player can save, manage relics, items, teleport and take on special challenges using the time shifting skills. Now with the details of gameplay out of the way it is time to talk about the downsides of AeternoBlade II.The 3D movement is a whole other issue, the camera seems to fight against the player while trying to control it, moving while trying to avoid attacks can obscure the players view, this is most prevalent during large scale battles against several enemies and boss battles, the camera can go out of bounds when too close to a wall which is a nuisance, one upside to the over the shoulder camera is the ability to lock onto the enemies, offsetting some of the camera difficulties.Controls for combat and movement are solid, with fluidity to them as the battles go on, there is a very little input lag when executing combo attacks and using the various skills, there can be some trouble during boss fights however as there is slowdown while playing in handheld mode, this is something that the developers are working on so hopefully it will be fixed in the near future.Visually AeternoBlade II is aesthetically pleasing, while not at the same resolution as the PS4 version the game still looks good on Nintendo Switch, the overall look is a mix between fantasy and anime, for an indie title it is very well polished, the environments have a lot of grandeur to them, the monsters and cast of characters are expertly animated, having a natural look to movement and are well designed with a lot of personality to them.The sound is a mixed bag, the soundtrack is done well with suspenseful atmospheric string based compositions, fantasy styled orchestral pieces and an opening piano theme with soft vocals layered over it. The sound effects used are effective with the clashing of blades having a nice impact during combat, voice acting is difficult to judge, again, being an independent release the quality of voice cast isn’t what you would expect from a big budget title but I feel it has its own charm to it.Overall, I enjoyed my time playing AeternoBlade II, there are flaws with the game but they aren’t significant enough for me to say the game isn’t worth playing, the camera issues take a little getting used to and will hopefully be addressed with an upcoming patch, the difficulty curve did have a level of frustration to it, but it wasn’t impossible and the lack of feedback through vibration/collision detection flaws did pull me out of the experience but I don’t see it as a deal breaker.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/aeternoblade-ii
