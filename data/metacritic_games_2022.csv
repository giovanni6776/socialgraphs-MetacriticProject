Full of humour and deep messages, a true successor of the first and the second Portal.

That mean if you don't get it, you don't get it. You walk, sometimes you can interact with objects and buttons, and that's all folks. To fully understand The stanley parable, one of the first scene is perfect. ""You have two doors in front of you. The narrator says you going to take the left door. Do you really want to take the left door or are you betray the narrator and try the one on your right ?"" That's all the magic of the game. The respect or the direspect of the narrator. The more you play, the more you find ways to challenge the narrator. Fun to play and really original.But what's new in The stanley parable : Ultra Deluxe ? Absolutely everything. The 2013's version is still one of my most iconic play in life. And i thanks me for playing the Ultra Deluxe at day one to avoid spoiler. Ultra Deluxe is presented as a remake from the 2013's version, with new content added. I'm not going to spoil.But the fact that you'll find all the orignal Stanley Parable content, the Ultra Deluxe content and the smartest surprises you'll ever find in a videogame... makes this game a real love letter to the game and the fans of the first episode. I enjoyed the time and felt rewarwed by the dev.I'm not spoiling everything. If you liked the first one you NEED to do this one. If you never played the first Stanley Parable, just go for it. Try it.

Rarely excited, he is fond of campy old Sci-Fi movies, with their giant robots and space invasions. But it seems like everyone in his life is trying to manipulate him for their own ominous ends... IORI FUYUSAKAShe believes she's an ordinary high school girl, with dreams and crushes and a sweet tooth. However, she finds herself at the center of a massive conspiracy, called on to stop an apocalypse before the world is doomed. What she's not sure about is: can she really answer the call? EI SEKIGAHARA A stoic young man with amnesia, Ei finds himself next to a dead body without any memories of his past. Declared a boy ""from another dimension"", he's constantly pursued by armed gunmen in black suits, and often finds himself in intense life-or-death situations. Through investing the clues and people in 1985, he chases the truth beyond his lost memories... KEITARO MIURA A dutiful young soldier from 1945, fiercely dedicated to defending his country. He'd lay down his life if it meant saving even a single soul. Chosen as part of a secret military program to pilot a new weapon called a ""Sentinel"", Miura soon discovers that his true enemies lie beyond World War II... MEGUMI YAKUSHIJIA shy, composed girl of few words, with a nurturing domestic side.

When she discovers a small robot hiding in the school, it seems like a story out of one of her favorite movies. However, she finds herself drawn into a massive, apocalyptic conspiracy in which the dangers of her favorite shows becomes disturbingly real. NENJI OGATAA high school punk with a heart of gold. He prefers to punch first and ask questions later, so when he gets involved in a convoluted conspiracy, most of the geek-talk goes over his head. Still, he's determined to bust through and save the girl -- even if he's resigned to her thinking he's just another thug. RENYA GOUTOA cold, brilliant young man who will use any means necessary to find the truth. Gouto processes information and startling revelations with a calm, ready intelligence that baffles (or outpaces) the adults around him. He's no villain, but he knows what's at stake, and what must be done. RYOKO SHININOME An aloof agent desperate to prove her worth to her unrequited love (and mentor) Tetsuya Ida. A mission gone wrong left Ryoko with traumatic brain damage, and dependent on a medicine of unclear origins. Still, she fights through the mental fog and pain to untangle the conspiracies... SHU AMIGUCHI An easygoing late-80s high school playboy, quick to make friends and quick to flirt.

But when his TV turns on by itself, and an idol starts talking to him through it, begging for his help unraveling a mystery...he rolls with it as best he can. TAKATOSHI HIJIYAMAA confident young Japanese soldier in the 1940s, displaced from his home and dropped into a city both foreign and familiar. Adrift, old-fashioned, and out of place, he struggles to make sense of all the changes in his world...and then, after months of living as a solitary vagrant, he finds the young man responsible for uprooting his life. TOMI KISARAGIA flippant, shy teenager. She often hangs out with her gal pals after school, getting snacks and chatting like any other, but she seems to know more than she lets on. Determined to investigate the mysteries of her fate, she surreptitiously follows whatever lead she can, only to discover even greater peril awaiting her... YUKI TAKAMIYA A surly delinquent who (reluctantly) infiltrates the school as a spy to save her best friend. Despite her disdain for her underhanded allies, she stubbornly seeks the truth when everyone else has something to hide. Tough and caustic, but she's got a protective streak and a sharp mind.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/13-sentinels-aegis-rim

If you love a good mystery, have an interest in film or art, or are simply looking for a good way to waste a few days, this is the game for you. This is really one of the most unique and ambitious games I've ever played. The acting is top notch, the story is engrossing, and the gameplay is unique. There's a truly impressive amount of content to be discovered. It's a riveting experience unlike almost any other game. Finding a new clip is extremely satisfying and unraveling the mystery will throw you through so many different emotions. This game definitely isn't for the prude or faint of heart, but if you're willing, this is absolutely worth a playthrough. The non-linear storytelling works very well with the mystery format. It truly does feel like you're unwinding a lost piece of history. One of my favorite elements (although admittedly a minor thing and not something that everyone would appreciate) is the use of different cameras and editing techniques within each of the Marissa's films. It really gives each of the movies a unique feel and does a good job of grounding them in the time period in which they were supposedly produced. Overall, I can see why some people might not appreciate this game (specifically if you're prudish/uncomfortable with nudity --although this is DEFINITELY NOT pornography, like some other reviews have suggested). Whether or not you appreciate this game will probably come down to the individual, although I have a feeling that this will be a cult classic for many, many years. This is an incredible experience for film, art, and mystery enthusiasts.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/immortality

The enemies are fun and challenging at times, but not hard enough to make you want to quit, just enough so that when you respawn you’re still ready to kill. The few problems stem from the rather underwhelming bosses, they’re just too easy and don’t require much skill (I played on medium difficulty) and it was just, Shoot, Dash, Shoot till I won, if the bosses had more variation it would’ve been more fun. An overall solid title and considering it was from an Indie title, it outdoes some of the other recent FPS titles made by AAA Studios. If you have Gamepass, give this a try.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-series-x/metal-hellsinger

L'ensemble game design plus musique vous met dans l'ambiance du début à la fin. En terme de gameplay, la mécanique de déplacement est agréable et facile à prendre en main, le shoot est assez permissif pas besoin de vous prendre la tête. Le panel d'arme est intéressant et chacune offre un gameplay différent et apporte vraiment quelque chose au jeu. La mécanique principale du jeu à savoir le rythme est géniale, ca apporte le côté skill du jeu et je la trouve bien exécutée. Il est indispensable de la respecter sinon vous verrez votre dps tomber en chute libre. Le système de finisher/glory kill à la Doom est très fun ainsi que le système des supplices après avoir terminé un enfer qui va vous apporter des défis supplémentaire intéressant et qui peuvent se révéler assez compliqués à passer. Ce qui m'amène à la difficulté du jeu. Il y a 3 modes de difficulté. Si chacun a un seuil de difficulté différent le jeu n'en reste pas moins difficile. Certains mobs/Boss pourraient vous donner du fil à retordre même en mode facile. Points négatifs, si vous mourez pendant un boss, il vous faudra rejouer l'enfer en cours depuis le début. Ca peut vite être assez pénible. Et second point, c'est trop court malheureusement, la re jouabilité n'est la que pour terminer les succès Steam.

The maps are large although there is still some sense of linearity, as you will end up outleveling some things significantly and usually have a main objective to work towards in a given direction. However the game maintains a good balance of this with stats increase being small enough and the number of side quests and secrets being rather plentiful so that you still have quite some choice with where to go next and what to do, without running into enemies that would be too easy or too hard for your character. Expect to die when you are unaware of new enemy mechanics, as the game is nicely design to still be challenging when you know how things work. It gives difficulty even when using low number of enemies, which act with some amount of unpredictability and damage potential. I expect it has a good replayability. It is playable in the highest difficulty mode from the get go. Sometimes, it may take a bit long to get something done, and some soundtrack may sound a little repetitive. It presents itself slightly like a game for kids, but it is difficult. You will notice that the achievements seem to be achieved by a small % of the players compared to other similar games.

There are plenty of physics platformers Celeste, Meat Boy, N+ etc. And there are lots of sidescrolling games with platforms, but very few stick at all to classic platforming design. I decided to buy the game because of the clear care put into it, I could tell that the developer knew what they wanted to accomplish, knew the aesthetic they wanted, and, in general, had a certain level of understanding for what makes a game great. This game really delivers. I would say it's biggest shortcomings are as follows: The levels are too long; This actually is quite noticeable, I will often turn my switch off halfway through a level. The repetitive music; You will hear this a lot about this game, it reuses a lot of the same music, and it isn't even particularly interesting. It mixes high difficulty with low difficulty too often; some of what you do will be too easy or forgiving, other parts will take you some tries. I think it is also worth note that to progress through the game you collect gems, or you collect berry things which get you more gems. In reality this is no different than collecting all the coins in super mario world, except you need them to progress. Personally I always tried to collect all the coins in old mario games anyways, even though you didn't really get anything for them. Also, I find the collecting in this game much less tedious than in the new Donkey Kong Country games, where you will often have to replay the entire level just to get a puzzle piece because you missed a banana. What the game does well is mixing platformer tropes to create a new experience. It feels a lot like playing a cross between mario, sonic, and shovel knight most of the time, but with a grappling hook that gives off Ninja 5-0 vibes, and an aesthetic that's pure Drill Dozer. It's definitely a game built for speed running, but that's the most modern concession to me, and even so, DK Country and SMB 3 are built for it too, even if it wasn't intentional. This genuinely feels like a lost gba gem, and despite it's flaws, it's a slick stylish platformer, with great touches, and a lot of depth. It can be challenging, but frankly most of the challenges are optional. It can also be a bit easy, but you can challenge yourself to make it harder. I really love this game, and am excited to see what the dev does next.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/grapple-dog

There were plot lines that meant nothing for it's story. Game had some disgusting violent scenes, but when some real violence happened and I would except you see it, it was off screen... There was a mini-game that was absolutely boring, meaningless and long. It was the worst part for me. And the ending... Khm... It was visually absolutely stunning, but it left me fully frustrated.

That's how our brain works, it tries to hide really painful and traumatic experience from us. Especially when person is I'll, he (she) can fully wipe it. Then, dollhouse mini-game. It was just awful. Boring, very long, without any sense. But. I realize now it was the only way for protagonist to ""understand"" what happened, to put it in order. She doesn't know what really happened, just like us. She is in the same position as we as players. Dollhouse, magical plot lines are made to show how her brain works, how hard is to put on order pretty simple things she saw by herself. How it's hard to catch up with reality. And the ending that gives literally zero answers and makes us to decide what happened is brilliant. It left me frustrated. Just like heroine was. She doesn't know what happened and she has to choose any option and to believe on it just to make her world more safe, structured. Once again, it's a weird and a bad game.

Honestly, I never made it past the first area because I go so impatient with seeing it with how many times it makes you play in it. The music for it is very, very repetitive. It starts off cutesy and nice, but when yoou've heard it loop constantly for 45 minutes, it really starts to grate. You get rewarded bones (or bonks) for completing objectives, but you never get the rewards for completing it.

On one hand, the on-court experience of trading a flurry of shots with your opponent is great – all thanks to a simple but effective control scheme and formidable opponents that will test your understanding of these mechanics. On the other hand though, everything supporting that basic structure like the career mode and training mini-games and player roster- all end up feeling barebones. Topping it all off is a lack of support for additional game modes like doubles tennis alongside a visual and audio presentation that leaves a lot to be desired.

The only two to walk away from the cataclysm unscathed, the hapless everyman known as the POSTAL Dude and his loyal companion Champ, drive aimlessly through the scorching deserts of Arizona looking for a new place to call home. After a fortuitous gas station rest stop ends with their car, trailer home, and the rest of their worldly possessions stolen, all the Dude’s seemingly got left to his name is his canine cohort and his bathrobe, and neither of them smells all that great. However, on the horizon, the duo glimpses an unfamiliar and dazzling town that beckons to them. What untold prospects lie within? Fame? Fortune? Maybe a bidet or two? Edensin awaits. POSTAL 4: No Regerts is a satirical and outrageous comedic open world first person shooter and the long-awaited true sequel to what’s been fondly dubbed as ""The Worst Game Ever™"", POSTAL 2! (No third game is known to exist.)",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/postal-4-no-regerts
