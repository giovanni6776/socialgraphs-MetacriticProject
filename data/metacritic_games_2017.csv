Roughly about 6 hours. If you've played ""To The Moon"", you will feel right at home as ""Finding Paradise"" is in many ways the same as the first game in the series. That is not to say this is a criticism.So we have another dying patient that has a wish which the two doctors Neil and Eva will try to fulfill. These two make a great comic duo yet again and their jokes will make you laugh. There are some references to ""To The Moon"" and some other winks towards pop-culture. I did find it interesting that during one scene, Kan even reflects through the characters on how mixed of a reception ""A Bird's Story"" had (I loved it, btw). For some, the interface, graphics and limited 'gameplay' will be a minus, but we all know that it is the story that makes ""Finding Paradise"" a real gem. And this one will stay with you as well. While we explored more of a 'love' theme in ""To The Moon"", ""Finding Paradise"" touches more on regrets, loneliness and growing up. And yes... someone will be cutting onions again towards the end. Even though I guessed it this time, I am still going to say it didn't disappoint. The soundtrack is where the game shines as well. It's a masterpiece by itself and I will listen to it once it is released. Just to give you an idea how great it is - I deliberately stayed longer in some rooms, just so I can enjoy the music. And we will have some cameos from ""A Bird's Story"" and ""Quintessence"". So... grab some tissues, switch off your phone and just enjoy playing it.

It combines a good sense of adventure, wonder, and exploration.  A very well made farming simulator.  A simple and sweet story.  Tons of interesting things to do.  All with a very cute and visually pleasing art style.  There are multiple different game play loops that are all interesting or fun on their own right.Exploration is very fun, Each area has its own hub of sorts, and some places more hidden and out of the way.  The problem with them is that most hidden areas usually don't have anything if you get to them, but honestly exploring and finding these places is fun enough that I don't need an award.  If anything, to me personally, I prefer that there isn't anything in hard to get to places, because it feels less like I discovered something I was supposed to find, and more like I stumbled upon this little place outside the game, its rewarding in it's own right.  Anyway, the farther out you go, the more difficult the slimes are to manage, in the first area, the most difficult slime is Rock, because it damages you a bit.  By the last area, slimes can cause tornadoes and fiery explosions.  Having to adapt to the chaos of the slimes is fun.The story is really nice as well.  It's told mostly in messages strewn about the world, and letters you receive, so you don't need to know the story if you don't want to, but I'd recommend looking into it.  It's nothing complicated, just a simple love story with the message of settling down, but I like that it isn't complicated.  It's simple and sweet, just like the rest of the game, so it fits very well.  The game has a perfect mix of not telling you what to do, without actually leaving you in the dark too much (unless you're like that one reviewer, Mandulum, who didn't know how to unlock the doors to the other areas).The visuals are great, the colors are nice, and all of the slimes are adorable(, my personal favorite is the Crystal Slime).  Farming is good, you make money off of feeding your slimes, and the more difficult the slime, the more profitable it is to do so.  So you can buy upgrades to your farm to make it easier to deal with slimes as the slimes get more chaotic.  It's balanced fairly well so its never too easy nor too hard to keep your farm in check.  A problem you could think of when looking at the world map is that it's too small, but realistically you can't leave your farm for more than 2 days at a time, because slimes get more chaotic the more hungry they are, so you won't be able to explore everything for a while.  This serves to keep you more interested in the world, as forward progress is generally small.  You could play the game without farming at all, but there are various upgrades you can give yourself with money that you'd then miss.  Such as more inventory, faster movement, more health, more energy, and a jetpack!  The farming never feels like its keeping you from exploring either, its a perfect source of downtime.  It's not difficult, but it's engaging.  The various possible upgrades to the farm kept me interested, and wanting to make everything as efficient as possible.  Something about it is addicting in the best possible way.  There are a few other sectors to your own farm you can unlock as well, the most game changing being the Slime Science area.This mechanic makes the game far more interesting, now you can craft teleporters between the outside areas, item transporters, many decorative objects, and many other random things to play around with.  It makes the possible efficiency of your farm to the next level.  On that matter, the game is crafted perfectly so it's impossible to fully automate your farm, no matter what you do, and I like that.  It is a farming simulator on some level, so its good that no matter what you do, you still need to do something to keep it running.  The slime science area also allows you to unlock ""Treasure Pods"".  These are strewn about the world, and cannot be unlocked unless you open the Slime Science area.  But the Slime Science area is so expensive that you'll probably only unlock it after you've already explored all the areas, meaning it's the perfect incentive to go back out and explore even more.  Especially because most recipes to craft Slime Science things are in these.  The game also has 3 free pieces of DLC, each of which is like an advanced mini game.  I'll be honest, only 2 of these are interesting, the other one's kind of annoying, but that's just my opinion.I know that this is way too long (hell I just had to delete what I was planning to be my second to last segment just to fit into the character limit), but I cannot emphasize enough how good this game is.  It's my second most played game on Steam at over 500 hours.  It's only $20 on Steam, it's totally worth it.  11/10.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/slime-rancher

There isn't even an in-game platform for it. I was afraid it would simply be a platform to sell clothing packs, it certainly is not. You can use amiibo with it, but you can use any amiibo and all you get for it as an emblem which kinda looks out of place in the rest of the game. It is a Nintendo product, and I have to give them props for not being slimy about it. Secondly, this is NOT just a virtual dollhouse. It's shop management game and a rather long virtual novel-style game with a truly massive amount of content for the dress-up portions. Along with 8000 styles for women's clothing and accessories, there is also a huge number of men's style in-game as well. Quite simply, it's a must-have if you're looking for an engaging dress-up game appropriate for most ages. Play the demo if you're interested, and you can see whether you get hooked on it like I did. Most of the game revolves around you managing a boutique and recommending clothing to customers- offering endless chances for dressing up the many characters in the game. In order to run it well, however, you have to stock up on clothing styles. Fans of shop management games will feel at home, as you can customize the way your shop looks, outfit your employee, and customize what you want to put on your mannequin in the shop window. It's not terribly deep- you're not managing rent expenses or payroll and can't even change the price of the items, but the game excels at keeping the fun parts of management without getting bogged down into micromanagement. Especially for a younger player, it might be a fun way to learn some money management and some basic commerce along with the dress up. The clothes themselves come in a truly impressive amount of variety of style. There are 14 different (fictional) brands you can buy from, and it covers a very broad range of styles. You get a small number of brands in the beginning and unlock more as you level up. Everything from very colorful and vibrant clothes to the highest-end chic styles. Fans of lolita fashion will also be at home, as there is a broad range of lolita fashion items (even if they prefer the term 'baby-doll'), from sweet to gothic and most things in between. The game communicates the very positive message that there is no right or wrong fashion style or sense, and that it should be a way to communicate one's personality and personal style. I wouldn't expect to see many people actually dressing in many of those styles outside of a cosplay convention, but there you go. What may not be obvious from simply looking at the eShop is how story and character-rich this game is. Every character- yes EVERY single person who comes into the shop is a unique character with their own name, preferences, and personality. A number of major characters come into the game near the start and have what turn out to be very long story arcs, mostly involving becoming idols. Yes, the game is Japanese and is very much on the idol bandwagon. Even if their goals are the same, they have very different personalities and personal conflicts which get them there. It's not a masterpiece of storytelling or anything, but it's more than enough to keep your interest and give a sense of progression as you level up. There's many many words in this game. For a younger player, it may be a good way to get them to read more, but it could be TOO much, and some of story elements or jokes may go above a younger player's head. There are few true negatives about the game. There is virtually no variation in body type- more or less a necessity so they can add as many styles as possible without having to change every one for body type. The act of actually stocking up can be considered quite tedious at times- there are easier ways to manage it's probably the least fun thing about the game, but not so horrible as to take away from the fun things. On some technical notes, the game LOOKS fantastic- there is very little of the 3DS' signature aliasing issues, and the textures look about as good as they can for the 3DS and it never looks bad.

As a seventeen-year-old student preparing for his new life at Thors Military Academy, however, he notices that his crimson uniform differs from the standard outfits issued to his peerstypically green for commoners, and white for nobles. Enter, Class VII of Thors Military Academy.

With nine hand-picked students of various backgrounds and abilities, Rean included, Class VII readies itself to dive deep into the political quagmire that threatens not only them, but the very foundations of the Empire.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel

This game is definitely one of the best games in the PSP library. I admit that the main reason I play this game are the portraits and general Art Style of it, yes, they are by the same author la Zero and Ao no kiseki, Katsumi Enami. I love his work and he will do the illustrations for Kuro no Kiseki too :) The story is a classic JRPG adventure re-imagined and smaller in scope, which silly I prefer than that 'whole world is over' chatter. It has some unexpected events that break the rhythm of the story that I really loved (2 specific moments). But apart from those 2 moments it's a decent story. The ending is decent too with a brief highlight. So overall I just consider it that, a decent story with 2 high points. Something very annoying is that it lacks in terms of execution of most of the scenes, part of the blame is on the hardware, but not entirely. The world has a pretty good wealth of NPCs. And why make Adol a 'silent protagonist', in Ys VIII it was like that too, but there she had expressions and you chose more complex phrases and 'spoken' more. And from what I read in Ys IX this improves even more. The gameplay is pretty simple, too much actually, but it entertained me enough and it has good boss fights. It amused me. The first Boss fight is fairly difficult and cool. And the tree forest dungeon already has a better and more interesting level design than usual. And the insect boss was pretty good. And damn the Fire Boss Fight I liked it a lot. Damn the bird was for me the most challenging so far. The octopus was fun but easy compared to the others.The level design even though limited by hardware is good and simple, it worked for me. And the 'synthetize' system I really liked, you build the weapons to get the skills and such. The Earth Dragon Boss fight is badass too and the dungeon good. As for fire, both the boss fight and the dungeon were just mediocre. The wind dungeon is a little better than the fire dungeon and the boss too. Now the water one I liked a lot more, both the dungeon and the original boss fight. And Moon Dragon is a Boss of respect too. Well of Souls is pretty good and Scias Boss fight is one of the most challenging even if not very original (level 56 passed). MY GOD THAT SUCKS, serial who has to use ALL the characters in the last boss fight, what a DISGUSTING, I think I'll have to grind. The Final Boss Fiht was pretty good even, but man, this thing about using all party members is a SAW BAG.I really like how the game doesn't even need markings or arrows to tell you where to go, I only realized I had that in a crash after 6 hours of play. Apart from this second arc where at times it is totally lost unfortunately. And the gameplay with Aisha is one of the best and I found it very original. The variation of enemies, scenes and soundtrack is another extremely important point in a game like this, as its gameplay can easily get cloying. Despite the cliché, the variation of scenarios is decent and the variation of enemies is good. Kylos Village is massive and original for example so it has some excesses going on. And the soundtrack variation is pretty good.Very good game design overall. If there's one point that's really negative about gameplay, it's your party's AI. When you are getting resources they ignore you and go after an unreachable mob or when you stop attacking a mob they leave too even if the mob is on their side. Also, they don't focus on mobs that have weakness against them.Another thing is that compared to Ys VIII besides the game not having that decrease in time to dodge the game has one less 'layer' in combat, the air. The graphics aren't horrible or anything in general, now the character models are, and even worse than being ugly, they're pretty unfaithful to the portraits. Which by the way are all magnificent. The game has 0 VA during cutscenes, the characters just moan as they attack... It's a PSP port so you can understand it but it's a shame there wasn't an improved PS Vita version like Trails. Very good opening, really good music and reminds me of Trails (too much for my taste). And if goofing off the version without vocals is better than the vocals dude, because that's rare for me. The face... has soundtracks, but they are highly similar to Trails, especially the quieter ones like villages for example. They are probably just the same songwriters but they needed to give identity to each franchise, as it is today for example. Cold Steel 1 and 2 have a very different track from YS VIII with rare excesses. The 'exploration' trails I found to be the best and most original in general. How easy is it to do 100%",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/ys-seven

That’s not to say games don’t do it – Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is one of the more notable games in recent years to do this. But it’s a bold approach. When a game not only does that, but creates a sense of deep emotions within the first few minutes, and follows it up with deep combat and puzzle-platforming, you know you’re in for something truly special. The feeling I get when playing this game is the same I receive from playing something like Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and a number of older Zelda games. Finding items off the beaten path is just as exciting as progressing in the story. Getting into fights with enemies much larger than you and having a little fanfare once you defeat them is rewarding and something to cherish. Gaining new abilities allowing for you to backtrack to puzzle pieces you saw previously that you couldn’t quite figure out feeds the love for metroidvanias. One of the nicer features I found while solving the puzzles the game has to offer is that it doesn’t force you to complete them again if you die. If there’s a timed puzzle that you complete and you end up falling off the ledge right after (very possible with some of the fixed camera angles), you don’t have to worry about rushing through it once again. The game offers a lot in terms of content, and the challenges are also quite dubious. While you’ll likely be upgrading your character your first run, subsequent playthroughs challenge you to beat it with less than 5 deaths (Limbo, anyone?) and no optional upgrades. These are certainly doable, as the game offers a few difficulty options, but fun and worthy challenges nonetheless. The skills that were learned in the creation of the Torchlight series are evident here. The level creation, the ability to see your character through the environment with the fixed camera (love this so much – I forgot how much I prefer to not have to control the camera in this type of game), and the overall art direction are all reminiscent of my time with their previous games. Perhaps my favorite character of the game is the world itself. While many games boast a living, breathing, open world, they still often feel lifeless. In this, you can’t stray too far off from the provided paths, lest you be hurt or killed by the fauna on the walls – be they toxic or not. This may be seen as a cheap tactic, and it can be depending on how it’s implemented, but it’s done so masterfully here. Perhaps the most awe-inspiring part of the game is when the world itself changes by your doing. You’ll see this a bit from the robot at the beginning, but soon you’ll be making much bigger changes to the world you live in. Whether it be a dungeon or simply a wall to walk across, the ever changing world is one of the coolest aspects you’ll find in video games today. I’m hoping that this ends up a sleeper hit, as people start seeing and hearing just how solid of a game it is. If you were to ask what my contenders for game of the year are right now, it’d be between Persona 5 and Hob. Yes, I’ve played Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Horizon Zero Dawn, and the other heavy hitters from the year. No, I didn’t feel as inspired by them as I did with P5 and this. If you’ve been searching for that game with the special something you can’t find elsewhere, you’ve found it.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/hob

You receive these missions from the only character who won't end up dead, because they're the tutorial character. These personal missions of breaking into spaceships require you to first, take on lots of other missions which involve breaking into spaceships. So, you grab a character and off you go, in your tiny pod of a spaceship which has no guns, just the ability to be so small that the enemy doesn't notice when you've docked onto them. The flying through space is controlled with the mouse, and is really fun to get good at, you'll start by crashing into the side of the enemy and hoping to dock, only to ping off the side, but the more you play, the quicker and easier you'll find it to dock. Of course, if you fly too close to the windows they're going to shoot you, and you will go spiralling through space to your death, or survival, depending on how you are with quick time events in which you can pause, so often you just need to make it back to base to repair your pod. Once you haven't been blown up by the enemy and have successfully docked, the space raiding begins. Before walking through the airlock just for the enemy to hit you with a wrench and throw you back out again, you can look over the whole ship, no fog of war, you can see where everyone and everything is, but that doesn't mean you won't be spotted by a patrolling enemy the second you step through the airlock because you weren't paying attention. Once you've snuck on it's time to head for the objective, either kill or collect, whether it's an item, a person, or the ship itself. Of course, you'll want weapons, and by taking out enemies and going through boxes you can gather yourself a hefty arsenal. There isn't just guns and wrenches, there is a manner of interesting and useful gadgets, such as swappers which swap you with an enemy, so they shoot themselves, and subverts which hijack enemy technology so it works for you. These shields and cloaking and so many more are there to help you out of the sticky situations, you may accidentally throw the enemy with the key to progress out of a window, but by using a swapper you can swap with someone on the other side of the door. You could use a visitor to teleport into a room of six people, take two out with a shotgun, shoot another with your other gun, throw your short sword at one whilst you dive at another with your longsword, and be teleported back to your original position before the last one shoots you. Pausing is the most powerful weapon you have, it allows you to perform these awesome stunts which are always the most rewarding part of any mission. Once you've completed the mission it's probably time to leave, you could run back to your pod, fly the enemy ship and blow others up with it on the way back or smash through a window and remote control your pod to pick you up before you run out of air. If shot or knocked out, the enemies will throw you out of the airlock, which means you have to frantically fly your pod to pick you up whilst the counter ticks down to your inevitable death, which may be today, maybe tomorrow. Once your back at a base, you can buy new items, train, do defector missions which you unlock with each space station you take controller of by levelling up through missions, or retire your character and select a new one. Although your character has little story, you still feel bad when they're retired or die, mainly because you lose all the gadgets they’ve collected over their past missions, and the progress on the personal mission, it can be devastating when you finally kick the bucket on the mission which would have unlocked their personal mission. But characters are replaceable, and the different difficulties of mission allow you to start gearing up before having to face the harder missions again. Through the game you unlock more ways of doing missions, like bloodless or no witnesses, these missions will still pay you if you don’t complete them within the perimeters, just they’ll pay you less. This means you don’t feel totally defeated when you wonder on a ship in a bloodless mission and forgot to bring anything non-lethal. This game encourages risking near impossible feats, encourages creative ways of completing your mission and is fun to play for a few minutes to a few hours, with great re playability. Although the missions are all a variation of the same thing, there is uniqueness in the procedural generation and defector missions, one of which starts you in space, making you use a gun to propel yourself through space.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/heat-signature

A polished, ambitious, graphically impressive action-adventure, built atop solid, old-school platform mechanics, it was a far better answer to Mario and Zelda than Alex Kidd ever could be. But it arrived relatively late (1989), on a platform that by then was failing in America, and basically dead in Japan (its Japanese release was cancelled outright, though it was later ported to Game Gear). After nearly three decades as a cult classic, relegated to the shadows behind better known NES titles, The Dragon's Trap gets the respect it deserves with a remake that is both lavish and lovingly faithful to the source material. The new artwork truly puts it among the finest-looking 2D games out there, with beautiful hand-drawn sprites that look like they came right off a comic book page. The art style is not slavishly faithful to the original, and the influence of French and Belgian comics shows, but it captures their tone and intent in a way only a true fan could. Music has been arranged for real instruments and performed live, and is generally wonderful, doing justice to a very memorable soundtrack. But underneath the modern veneer, the gameplay remains untouched. This is not an attempt to modernize a dated title, but rather to bring one of the great masterpieces of the 8-bit era to a new audience. While it's unmistakably old-school, and some design decisions may run counter to modern gaming conventions, it's really a testament to the strength of the original how much it holds up today. For nostalgics and purists, you can even switch to retro graphics and/or sounds with a button press, although the new visuals are so appealing, I mostly just used this to compare what had been done. Overally, it's easily one of the best remakes of an 8-bit game ever, and a clear labor of love by a team of dedicated fans. It'll be interested to see if Lizard Cube continues with the series, either remakes or an original title.

All of the core gameplay from the last game remains but has been expanded in some new and rather interesting ways, more on that later.One of the first things I should mention is how deeply I am impressed with the developers of this game, the core game is free and includes one table however you are able to import almost all of your old tables from Zen Pinball 2 (FX2 on the pc). This means the game has a very impressive starting line up of tables and previous customers are not asked to re-buy tables again to get access to the new features, in this day and age that loyalty to fans is a rare commodity.New to this version is the “Upgrades” system, this allows you to level up score multipliers, bumper scores etc to give you a bit of an edge on the tables. These upgrades can be used in the new “Match up” and “Tournament” modes along with Wizard powers!So what are Wizard powers? Sadly you can not unleash fireballs on your rival pinballers, what you get is a lot more useful and leaves fewer soot stains!There are 3 Wizard powers per table;Rewind timeScore BoostSlow motionTo earn the Wizard powers you play the new challenge modes.Each table has 3 challenges, the first two are self-explanatory 1 ball and 5-minute time limit. The 3rd challenge is survival, which gives you a 60 second time limit to reach a target goal, once you hit that goal the target is increased and the timer reset. All of these modes are fun to play and help you get a good feel for the table.The Tournament mode allows you to go up against the world (all systems share the same scoreboards for these) by creating a set of rules, a time limit of anything from 1 day to a week and picking a table or playing someone else's. The options you have are immense and yes you can turn off the Wizard powers and upgrades to make for a level playing field. Personally, I am partial to the 5-minute tournaments where you have to score as many points as you can in 5 minutes.The last new game mode is “Match up” this is more your official huge tournament, 4 tables are picked by the zen studio guys at the start of each week and you can play them all (if you own all of them) or just keep replaying your favourite. Each table has 3 scores you can choose to beat, think of them as easy, medium and Hard if you beat the score you choose within the 3-minute time limit you get some points (you get bonus points for playing more tables and/or dominating your chosen score. At the end of the week, those in the top 20% move to the next league of the tournament and those in the bottom 20% drop back to the last league. Given that all systems compete in the same tournament it can be pretty tough to get in the last 20% and sadly it does mean that those with more time to play will fair better regardless of skill. PROSRealistic ball physics.A huge improvement over the last game which was already rather good.You can import already owned tablesHuge list of tables (68 in fact)Every table is fully featured and animated, the detail that goes into these is awe inspiring.The new tournament mode allows you to challenge people long after your mates have looked at your high scores and backed away shaking their heads.The unlock system is a unique idea in pinball and one I found really enjoyable.It really is the best pinball game I have ever played (and I have been playing them on and off since pinball fantasies on the Amiga!)All three main systems share the scores and tournaments, that is a lot of people to play against.It is a free game (with 1 free table)You can trail any table for 5 minutes as many times as you want before purchase. CONSNot all the tables made it over to FX3 (including my old favourite, Plants vs Zombies) it is my hope they will be added later though I suspect there were licensing issues.Due to the way tables are sold in packs, it is possible to have a table or two from importing that is in the pack meaning you may have to re-buy some tables to get the missing ones (far from ideal)Die-hard pinball fans may not like the upgrade system, but it is optional.New users only get one table free.Despite the “match up” mode being 3 minutes long and the trials of tables being 5 minutes, you can not use the trial versions of tables in match up. VERDICTWell, I said it in the Pro section, this is the best pinball game I have ever played the mix of realistic ball physics and unrealistic but awesome table features, it really is a hell of a lot of fun. Add in the competitive features and the fact that all major systems can compete together in the tournaments and you have an amazing game.So yes I recommend it, grab yourself some tables too.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/pinball-fx3

It's also heavily influenced by the anime Angel Beats, in which teens that have died tragically early deal with a bizarre afterlife patterned after a high school. The good apples are souls that try to obey the hellish rules of the school to graduate and move on, while the bad apples are rebels who try to defy this fate and seek to escape the school whole. What's nice about this game is that the love interests are split up between the good and bad sides, giving you a better look at the story than many otome games. You see all sides of NEVEAH academy, and in the routes I played, there is substantial additions to the story with the different interests. The art is striking too, very colorful and with great, lanky character designs. All are fashionable too, my favorite being the samurai-loving side character who is dressed in perfect 80s prep (which looks wonderful!) The plot is fun, and the characters are very lively. Unusual for a visual novel, there are a ton of well fleshed out side characters, much more than many otome games. The story despite being derivative was nice, too, and I enjoyed it much. So then why a 6? The problem is that it feels a bit slapdash and lacking in the presentation. There are minor characters who play a decent role in the plot, like the sleepy sounding girl Akki, but get no picture at all despite being fully voiced, and voiced well. The actual art assets beyond the stylish presentation are simple even by otomate standards, with only a few different poses, and not much in the way of cgi or effects. It feels a bit bare bones at times, compared to Code: Realize or Malice x Collar. Some people dislike the odd font they use for lettering in the game, but I didn't mind it. The biggest issue though, is the fault of the localizers. There's a mechanic where you touch your love interest in order to hear his inmost thoughts, which are spoken...but in Japanese, with no subtitles! This has no effect on gameplay, but considering these moments happen at critical points in the storylines, it would be nice to know what they are saying. So on the whole, it's a decent Otome game with some nice points, but it really needed a little more work on the presentation to shine. It's comparable to Period: Cube, but falls short of the best otome games on the Vita.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/bad-apple-wars

Originally I didn't like it but later it made sense and I enjoyed it more, not having to replay levels. Unlike the other games this one has each ""level"" be a part of the open world city. So unlike the previous games this one really doesn't need a replay. You simply find the items you're looking for in the open world. Also, unlike the previous games, this one has far less stuff to do which means they are better overall and not the filler we're used to seeing. Fortunately there are also only a couple of times you need to deal with the horrific vehicle controls. For the most part it is just collecting the standard stuff. Overall I found this to be one of the easier LEGO games which means it is great for kids. I didn't really understand or care about the ""combat moves"" that were introduced. I just button mashed and things broke. The various unlocks are also not at all useful. But overall it was fun. There are some bugs like we've seen in previous games. I've fallen through the scenery a couple of times and had a crash once. The newer problems include a noticeable stall after a cutscene which only impacts one of the characters. Switching to the other and back solves the issue. Additionally there are cases where mission start indicators won't appear unless you reload the area. Some races cannot be started unless you switch to another character.

That said, it's not a cash-in, it's a heartfelt, and well thought out game, that harks back to an era that makes my nostalgic muscles twitch to no end. Phantasy Star, Lunar, Chrono Trigger, Suikoden. I could keep listing, if you've been around for long enough, or haven't but still loved these games, this game is for you, no question about it. The battle system is excellent; interesting to work with, at Heroine difficulty (the 3rd of the 4, which I recommend playing it on) - it really pushes you to think a few moves ahead with each character, and as a whole team, to ultimately get extremely satisfying results once you figure out that tactic for each fight. It's not just the boss fights that are interesting, every fight is, and as you progress, level up, get more gear and get wiser, you enjoy it more, you're rewarded for being a good player and a tactician in the field of battle. I love it. The characters are charming, with a zany sense of humor that is reminiscent of that in the Lunar series. Zeboyd know how to handle subtle references, and they know how to handle humor, so there are a few good times I've both smiled and laughed out loud. There's a wealth of NPCs with funny tidbits here and there to share, as well as being useful for tips on battle, items, techniques, and quest clues. It's all in the world around you, you just need to look. The resolution at 1920x1080 is NOT blurry - i'm playing on a 43"" TV at 1080 and it looks terrific, so I can wholeheartedly say that's not true at all. I've not had any stages where my game save has become corrupt, nearly 16 hours in now and I've not encountered any bugs, actually. That said, they're there, I've spoken to others, and I've seen them. However the developers have patched since these other rancid reviews were posted, and are working to another patch extremely soon. Rather than slate the developers in to the ground, these users could have reported the bugs, yes stil be annoyed because a buggy game is an annoying game, but at the very least communicate that frustration to the developers. They're not trying to get away with anything, they're 4 years in on a labor of love and they could have used more time, yes, but they didn't have it, so whatever small bugs are being encountered, and big ones, they've tackled most of them already and are weeding out the remainders. The story is good, characters are charming, the artwork is fantastic and the overall aesthetic will pull you in if you've a nostalgic bone in your body. At an estimated 15-20 hours gameplay, for the price of $14.99 (currently $11.99 for another 24 hours I think) you cannot ask for better value for money. People raging on this game at the loud minority, and I only wish people who have played and enjoyed the game thoroughly would speak up for their experiences, both good and bad, but at some way to support the vision of CSH and the development team, tiny a team as it is. If you're not sure, watch some playthrough of it on youtube, but if you are liking it, stop watching, and go grab it, to avoid spoilers.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/cosmic-star-heroine

But the rounds go by so fast that I never felt I was using my brain...I was reacting, frantically rotating shapes and placing them trying to create blocks and fill up the score bar at the bottom…I felt there was never time for me to think ahead...Because of this I never felt I was making progress with the game… just that I was mindlessly going through levels getting lucky while some cool music played in the background…Another issue I have that also stops any feeling of progression is that every board gives you different shapes to use and it doesn’t tell you the shapes that level uses beforehand so you have no idea what to build for or how you should be setting up slots for future shapes..To be fair, you can eventually memorize the shapes for each level and make a note yourself... though you shouldn’t have to... but you can...But even if you do so, this will hardly matter for some levels because the difficulty of them are based solely on the color scheme of these levels…as you clear blocks they change colors and in some stages the color matches too closely with your shape in hand so it’s hard to see where you’re placing anything…Chime Sharp is a cool idea…But the timer is too fast.. It’s sometimes too hard to see the board… and the game constantly changes the rules without telling you…It’s an alright puzzle game… definitely a challenge…but for all of the wrong reasons.I give Chime Sharpa 6/10",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/chime-sharp

53,The Escapists 2,playstation-4,"Aug 22, 2017","['iPhone/iPad', 'PC', 'Switch', 'Xbox One']",75,6.8,Mouldy Toof Studios,Team17,"['Action', ',                                            ', 'General', ' ']",Up to 4 ,T,"If there’s one thing that is used as a level in games more often than not, it’s being locked up in a jail of some sort. Whether it be the start to a game (Elder Scrolls), or a strategy to take everything away and create a type of escape/stealth mission where you must not only escape your cell, but also must reacquire your gear, it’s a common trope you’ve no doubt seen in video games. One of the reasons this is used over and over is because it’s a fun change from the rest of the game, and an easy way to switch things up. But what if you were tasked with escaping from multiple prison cells as an entire game? The Escapists 2 expands on the gameplay and options provided in the first entry, while adding a lot of content and features. On top of a more polished game, you’ll be tasked with escaping moving prisons and having the option of doing so along other players. The latter of these two options was especially important to me, as my wife and I are always looking for something to play together, and it seems most games don’t offer the option anymore. This not only allows for local co-op, but online co-op and versus modes. Will you work together to escape the prison, or will you use the other for personal gain and leave them in prison? In versus you will be competing against the clock to escape the fastest, while there isn’t really a time limit with the co-op. All the local modes involve a split screen down the middle, and four squares if you’re popular enough to have three friends. For those unfamiliar with The Escapists, this offers a tutorial prison in which everything is told in the form a flashback from the comfort of a beach. It teaches you the basics of what to expect in the actual game, but there’s still a lot that you likely won’t pick up from completing that alone. As you explore the first real level by yourself, you’ll come to understand the game proper. You’ll do favors for other inmates, which will earn you money that you can use to pay for items, purchase hints, and use for bribes. I didn’t find every facet the game has to offer, and I’m 99% certain all of the escapes have single player ways of approaching them, but it was a great addition to the game having to work together to get into certain areas. Simply teaming up to build certain items for your daunting task is exceedingly fun – especially when you’re playing together in the same room and can communicate directly. The game also offers emotes with the D-Pad, letting you communicate online for those that don’t have two systems set up next to each other. However, playing online also means doing so with someone that may not be as friendly, and end up using you to get away. It’s a gamble you’ll face while playing online – albeit a fun one. Do you take the quick civilian route, perform the classic dig, pummel your way to victory, or follow some other means that may remind you of Metal Gear? These are only a handful of the escapes you’ll discover in your time prison-hopping. How do you choose to escape a moving train? Can you simply walk into space and be done with it? The previous entry was a sandbox as well, but this adds so much to the table. If you’re new to the series, it’s important to know that the game doesn’t wait on your every whim. Far from it, as you are in a prison full of routine. Miss something like lunch or exercise time, and your heat goes up. Get in a fight; expect to be put down quickly, by guards or the inmate you decided to give a wallop. If the place goes into lock-down, expect to get knocked out and wake up to peeling potatoes, along with losing all of your gear you spent so much time collecting and crafting. While you have a stash in your cell, it can be raided at any point, so you will want to hide your most valuable items in the secret compartment you are provided. What is at first a very minimalist character creator soon becomes a robust creation tool as you unlock new options through gameplay. The graphics got a bit of an update, so it certainly looks nicer. The prisons have many layers to explore, opposed to just one or two levels. It also features leaderboards for each level, with filters for everyone that plays the game, yourself, and friends you know – additionally, you can see whether they were playing Singleplayer, Multiplayer, or Versus. The Escapists 2 has this draw for success, despite likely involving lots of failure your first or fifth time through. I found myself telling my wife how we’d be breaking out of jail while eating, showering, and while she was sleeping. With multiple escapes to accomplish, competitive multiplayer, leaderboards, and co-op jailbreaks, it’s hard to not love everything this game has to offer.

So I played half at easy, half casual.

You can equip new items and tech power. You get a lot of puzzles like switch, keys, teleport, combination, traps. They go from simple to hard. There are 3-4 of them who were too hard because they rely on guessing more then deduction or hints. They were really annoying. I found the level without weapon refreshing, and you had to think how to kill the enemy. I would have prefer another section like that then a bad teleport puzzle. So, Vaporum could have use some small hints here and there for some of the puzzles and direction. Nothing major but useful. Otherwise I liked it, more then Grimrock but less then Might and Magic X.

The price of the game is only $30. Think of it more as an indie fighting game, not a triple A release trying to clone dark souls as others have claimed. One reoccurring complaint I see is the difficulty of fighting multiple enemies. Yes, in the first hour or two it is difficult, but it teaches you positioning and stamina management. Afterwards it is fun to fight two enemies. Another complaint is region locking. While I can understand this being frustrating, remember that this is a tiny dev team without the budget to do state of the art matchmaking or pay for dedicated servers across the globe. The only complaint I understand is the AI not wanting to leave their designed area. It is annoying when they run back to their spawn area if you pull them too far away. I imagine this was done to prevent frame drops and other QA problems by not allowing NPCS to be pulled too far and have too many on screen. Again, the dev team is tiny. I would hope this and other small nitpicks will be address down the road. All in all I would highly recommend this game. Just don't blindly purchase it without looking into what it offers.

I picked up Mask of Deception because it was sold to me as an SRPG. I played it and got tired of it for a while, on a whim I picked it up, and Once i finished the first few battles, I fell in love with the cast, the characters, the story, the music, the whole damn thing. It was such a fresh experience. Even the beginning which is almost all slice of life, felt engaging. The music and the writing really made you feel like you were there. When the story finally picks up though, you feel the rush coming, when the climax is at the peak, it leaves you wanting more, and that is where Mask of Truth picks up. It maintains the same music, and style of writing, which is perfect, but more of the story is shown, and It has all sorts of plot twist and turns, and each character death really made me feel something, whether it was a guy I hated, or someone i loved. I teared up multiple times during this game. Suara, (the singer of most of the vocals) does a great job on these games, in fact she also did the songs for the Anime as well. I highly recommend anyone who likes a fantasy style atmosphere in their anime. If you are playing this just for the SRPG elements, I would say shy away from it unless you love a good story, the battles are few and far between, but I didnt play Mask of Truth for the gameplay, I wanted to finish the story, and as this is the onyl way to see the sequel in a non manga form, I gladly shelled out the money to finish my story with Haku and Kuon. I honestly feel empty and happy at the same time, It is one of those games that you want to forget so you can do it all again. It reminds us of why we are only human, and that nothing is perfect.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/utawarerumono-mask-of-truth

I will entertain those accusations from those who have played more than just Persona 5. I feel like this is more of a nod to Persona than as a clone. This is the team that brought us Ys and Trails. And it plays like a modern action version of that, right down to a reported character, and the same menus.Anyways. The story follows an ordinary student who accidentally falls into another world that holds demons. There he meets a girl who has been fighting these demons. And so the story starts. Other characters join, and humans are kidnapped or drawn into the other world abyss.Pros-Decent music and average anime graphics. Comfortable combat featuring weapons and magic attacks, with  three different super attacks. The story is immersive, and I was never bored. It features social events and optional tasks or missions to get to know your classmates and pick up some items.  It also features mini games and an incredibly useful teleport menu system on the map. In school and need to be at the park? Teleport. I know what you're thinking here. Another element that was interesting was taken from Trails, and that was cooking recipes for power ups. The characters lacked that annoying one that you won't use to battle and skip in cutscenes; instead they were all generally likable.Cons - My only con was the fact that they went a little cliche with an element in the endings, and the fact that there are 3 endings. Think end, real end, and then after story end.And the skateboarding game. Overall, I put in over 100 hours and achieved a very frustrating platinum by beating it in Nightmare mode and Infinity mode.

Also, I loved the original to death and all of this colors my opinion. Super Cloudbuilt is wonderful, it is everything Cloudbuilt wanted to be polished to perfection. I put over 900 hours into the original Cloudbuilt, and while the core mechanics were phenomenal and I obviously love it it did have some obvious flaws. The story was a notable weak point and the whole game lacked a sense of polish, on top of that several of the game modes were prone to crashing and a couple of bugs with the movement simplified the game to much at the highest level. I'm happy to say that all of that has been addressed in Super Cloudbuilt The core of what made Cloudbuilt great is still here, that freedom of choice and the feeling of exploration is made all the more viceral by the redesigned levels and expansive design incorperated into every piece of the game. The movement is more refined, allowing new players to pick up the game more quickly and feel greater control over their motions. Demi feels as if she has actual weight and momentum now and the strange way Demi liked to get stuck on things in the original is gone. The story and level select have been overhauled from the ground up. The hospital hub world is compact yet full of detail and the fact that Demi's monologues can be listened to inside loading screens or as you begin a new level keeps them from breaking the flow as they did in the original. The voice acting is also much improved, as well as the writing. Finally, the polish. Everything about Super Cloudbuilt screams polish. The menus are sleek and modern, the inventory system is simple and effective, and everything is where you would expect it to be. All of this combined with a new global leaderboard system and the many gamemodes Cloudbulit has always had gives hours of content for those people who want to go fast while still providing rewards for those who want to play more casually. For me Super Cloudbuilt is a 10/10, everything about this game is an improvement upon the original and it has earned it's spot as one of my favorite games of all time.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/super-cloudbuilt

It is set apart from other entries in the depth of its story and character development. I never expected to feel emotionally connected to this game, given that the others tend to introduce characters, let you play as them, and then move on. By focusing on the exploits of the likable Sanada clan, everything is seen from a different perspective. Each victory and defeat means so much more in this format, and the introduction of other characters makes sense. Gameplay-wise, there's nothing new in the combat system but the 1 vs. 1000 hack-and-slash system is refined to perfection, with the usual versatile light, power, hyper, special and musou attack combos. With 50+ characters to play as (divided into story-relevant and peripheral), each with unique styles, special moves and strengths, it has never been more fun to smash through hundreds of petty soldiers with ludicrous weapons. The tactical depth of gameplay is at an all-time high too with the introduction of the Stratagem/Feat system. By performing Feats in previous stages (e.g. taking out a specific enemy, capturing all bases, or allowing a specific ally to survive), you unlock extra Stratagems in the next stage. These turn the tide of the battles immensely by uncovering map information, weakening bosses or speeding up player movement. Add to this the necessity to play as two characters and strategically command your partner to accomplish tasks at opposite ends of the map, and I loved every single battle. AI is generally quite good when given instruction, but occasionally allies can die at other ends of the map, ending the mission, when up against seemingly fair opposition, so be careful. The story is reasonably historically accurate (albeit exaggerated and perhaps adapted to a Sanada focus). Most characters are true to their historic motivations and major events in Japanese Sengoku history are all here (the Battle of Sekigahara, the two Sieges of Osaka etc). I truly learned something playing this and I can say that despite the same setting, SoS tells the story SO much better than Nioh (this isn't saying anything about their relative gameplays, mind). Furthermore, once a character has been encountered in the story, they are unlocked to play in Free Mode - you can play any stage you want with any character you want from the base camp Libraries. You can even 'buy' non-story characters from the mid-game onwards with items acquired through gameplay. It's so satisfying to see every single character across all of the SW entries available for play! My main criticisms of the game would be the necessary uninteresting 'skirmishes' where you roam around non-battle environments completing monotonous tasks between missions, collecting upgrade materials. They absolutely stall the pace. I can see the purpose of these, but the endless trawling around castle maps followed by 4 end-to-end skirmishes took the shine off the 'exploration' focus. The upgrade system for weapons didn't feel very relevant either, and the loot/gold system felt a bit shallow. Adding extra EXP to officers was available but almost impossible to use. I perhaps upped 10 levels in total across ALL playable characters using this feature. It seems broken. Finally, the camera drove me crazy sometimes. When entering Rage state, the camera swirls and zooms to your character dramatically (cool effect) but often moves the camera wildly away from the action, leaving you exposed, I died a couple of times due to this which is massively frustrating. Overall, I hate to see the way Warriors games are shunned when the amount of love and attention shown by Koei to Spirit of Sanada is evident at every turn. The greatest stress relieving game of all time, which I encourage other to pick up, learn some history, experience the most OTT samurai costumes ever, and destroy legions of puny enemies.

Watch some videos if you need but I would say this is a must own for psvr. Pros - Stunning Visuals, complex fun gameplay, no motion sickness, perfect controls. Cons - no single player beyond tutorial and challenges, no match making system so you will likely lose a lot in the first week. 10/10",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/sparc

I have to admit I did buy the game so I can make a joke of the title (but the original iOS title is really the joke-worthy title) and because it was one of the few games I wanted from the Nintendo Indie presentation back in August. But the game was actually very creative. I got a laugh about how extreme the boy's mom was about hiding the game, like by Day 4 she hides it in a crocodiles mouth. I do have one complainant, Day 9 is broken on the Switch version, because it is missing a fly in the window that is needed to knock over the obstacles in front of the closet... but they end up toppling over on themselves somehow without it. I only know this because I downloaded 'Hidden my game by Mom' (which was very poorly translated by the way) just to see what levels they included in the switch version and if it was just a port of the app (which it wasn't, it was collections of levels from that app and 'Hidden my game by Mom 2'). The ending of the game was actually kind of deep and hit an emotional chord with me, I was very surprised that they could get some sort of story element in this game. And after you beat all 50 days you do get some post game content, its kind of fun and every time you complete it you get a new end animation for the post game content and there was a lot of work out into that and its probably going to be overlooked by a lot of people.

Steam forums are full of them, they answer ALL threads within minutes and try to get feedback from every single player. That is nothing less than admirable for todays standards. And you can recognize what players asked for in many updates. I was already lured to this series by previous Starpoint Gemini 2, and then noticed they actually gave that game for free for 48 hrs before Warlords were released. Now, on to real review: this is freaking huge game. Open world is crazy big, there are dozens of factions, dozens of ship types, dozens of stations and planets. And gameplay is best part of everything. You get to use big capital ship in real time simulation combat, like Star Destroyers from SW, but when you achieve government of your state and borders, you get access to more deep gameplay - almost strategical. YOu can make many fleets, send them to conquer, attack, pillage, conquer. But at any time you can take your own ship and join every fleet in direct combat. Freaking awesome! Highlight of combat - mega weapon platform Proxima used to punch holes in rebelious planet. Very nice touch! Overall, in simple categories I would say:Gameplay - fantastic and very unique combination. Like few games in oneGraphics - very good, atmosphere is much better than anything else. Reminds of FreelancerSound - Sound is pretty good, soundtrack is brilliantDifficulty - if you advance carefully in skills, ship class and global movements, not a problem. Don't rush or you will be sorryTechnical quality of product - Except smaller bugs haven't encountered anything serious. Patches are coming frequently Verdict - whoever likes space games, trust me, you gotta try this!

55,Nidhogg 2,playstation-4,"Sep 15, 2017","['PC', 'Switch', 'Xbox One']",73,6.0,Messhof,Messhof,"['Action', ',                                            ', 'General', ' ']",2 ,T,"Two fighters lock eyes and charge at each other, both wielding their swords with the intent of murdering the other. One stabs low, the other high, and one becomes the victor as the other is disemboweled. As the champion runs, the defeated reappears with a dagger that he lobs, but misses. The sword is thrown in kind and stuck through the combatants head. The victor picks up his sword as he continues on and no sooner has to deflect a bolt that’s quickly shot from a bow, which inadvertently pierces the archer’s heart. It’s here that the winner is crowned with fame after being eaten by the Níðhöggr. If you’ve played Nidhogg, you can pretty much expect the same experience from Nidhogg 2. The largest differences are the amount of weapons available, and the graphics. The latter is quite a large jump from the original, which served its purpose well, but you can’t help but love the Sega feel that is brought about in 2 thanks to Toby Dixon. I highly recommend checking out his Tumblr that goes into the design of the game with Plasticine, as many games don’t make use of this animation method anymore. The game features extravagant backgrounds as you pierce your way through each level, running and jumping to safety. The music is also quite varied between the stages, creating a fun sense of ambiance. The game offers a few modes, including a single-player arcade, online, local versus (2 players), and local tournaments (3-8). The game has the ability to run indefinitely without a time limit, although it’s there for those that would rather not have the game end in a stalemate. This is almost impossible in the likes of the arcade mode, as the game has certain styles to learn as you play. My first time through the game I beat it in 21 minutes, and there’s a trophy for beating it in 20, which is more than doable once you understand the fundamentals. For those that have never played Nidhogg before, the arcade mode is a great place to learn how everything works. There is no tutorial, but the control scheme is hardly difficult. You run, jump, and attack. Attacks are dependent on how you move directionally, so you can be at a low, mid, or high stance. You are also able to throw your weapon, as well as go hand-to-hand or perform a dive kick. You’ll learn what works and what doesn’t while playing against the computer, as the characters more or less showcase the different things you can do with the weapons as you come across them. Some favor high stance, while others are insistent on going for your knees. While the arcade is a fun tutorial of sorts, the main focus of this game is the multiplayer. There’s nothing quite like sitting on the couch next to your buddy and yelling at them as they throw a sword and miss as you curb stomp them out of existence, only to have them stab you in the head as soon as they spawn. It brings back the joys of a simpler time, and it’s just as addictive as the old co-op/competitive games you used to play on Nintendo; just a bit more violent. There are plenty of strategies to playing this game, namely killing your opponent and running. But there are many intricacies to these, as you’ll learn by playing against others. What works well on one person will undoubtedly have a different result on someone else. In some instances, you may only have to kill them once the entire match and run through the rest of it, jumping over them and dodging their attacks. Others will hunt you down and be expert marksmen forcing you to kill them every time they’re on the screen if you hope to make any progress. Finding what their pattern of play is can be difficult, and almost a form of rock, paper, scissors when dueling. Note that whoever has the last kill controls the screen, and moving off of it as the loser means death. In addition to the danger that your opponent brings, the levels also have their own dangers that you must be careful of – many times after winning a duel I ended up falling to my death from rolling to pick up a weapon or just being clumsy. It’s rare that any of these events ever end up in frustration while playing against the computer, but it can mean life or death when going against a human. Nidhogg 2 brings what people loved of the first and amplifies it on every level. The game takes the competitive nature of old games and modernizes it, keeping the controls simple but the gameplay addictive. If you never played the first, don’t worry, this is the perfect game to jump into.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/nidhogg-2

I felt that the story was far more engaging with the Late Shift. I guess I like the choice and consequence style of gameplay more than the point-and-click style. You play as Matt Thompson, a college student who works the late shift as a valet/car park attendant. The night appears to be rather quiet, until a robber breaks into the car park, holds you up at gun point and forces you to drive to a house where a robbery is being planned. Unfortunately, the guy who kidnapped you suffers an injury when he broke into the garage and Matt is forced to take his place in the robbery instead. The robbery goes awry and you end up in the crosshairs of a Chinese triad gang, thus beginning the adventure to escape with your life based on the decisions you make. ""Gameplay"" is fine for what it is; a choice and consequence, FMV style game. Certain choices can lead to entire chapters being locked off until you try again on another play through, so there's at least some consequences for your actions. The acting is fine, it's kind of interesting to watch Matt's character arc quickly go from an average, innocent college student to a hardened criminal. The music is just kind of throw-away, although I wish they hadn't mixed the music to be so loud and the voices to be so low. I had to drop the music levels to about 60% just to hear what the actors were saying to each other. There are some technical issues I've found with the game. The subtitles and the actors lines don't match up on several occasions, there was one instance where I pushed my luck and managed to get a 50% share in the money for the robbery. The subtitles matched that decision when it played out, but the actor recited the line where it was only 25% (If you don't push your luck). There's also random multi-coloured bars that can flash up on screen momentarily and I get some frame rate slow down and acceleration with a number of scenes, leading to believe that maybe parts of this game weren't rendering correctly. Could simply be a console vs. PC thing. I do wish there was a way to check what choices you've made, what ending you got and even compare your choices globally with other players. I don't really care that I made X number of choices in a play through, when would that ever tell me anything of consequence? Overall, Late Shift is short, fun FMV game that I can recommend if, like me, you've never really played many FMV games. Do try to pick it up on sale, though. I picked it up for $7 CAD, as oppose to $12.49 CAD.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/late-shift

I was exceptionally impressed with Episode 2 with its fast paced action and gameplay and not to mention the plot twist at the end, leaving me in one of the biggest cliff-hangers in this entire franchise. Fortunately Episode 3 does an amazing job at continuing from all of the drama and continuing right where the end of the previous episode left Jesse and his friends and I am not disappointed by it. The writing done to this plot really works and really pays off. Our friend Jesse is sent to a deep, hidden underground prison/reformatory (hence the title of this episode; 'Jailhouse Block') after angering the mentally deranged admin for apparently not showing him as his 'champion' in the previous episode. We are once again reunited with most of the characters featured in the last episode (including the admin during the middle of the episode). The great thing about this is that the first character we are reunited with is determined out of the two characters (Jack or Petra) that was selected during the end of the last episode while deciding on who would go for the clock being the main goal of the episodes plot. This means that depending on who you selected, the beginning of this new episode will be slightly different, though no matter who it is, you will be introduced with an awesome, action packed intro featuring some point and click gameplay just like in Episode 3 of the first season. As well as that, we also get to see a couple of new characters in this episode such as the quirky Warden. We are even reintroduced with a couple of other characters previously seen such as Jesse's friend and assistant Radar, and Nurm the Villager. In the last episode, I had noticed a favourable bond between Jesse and Radar who I had also grown a bond too. During the beginning of this episode however, he is the victim of the episode first major decision which the Warden uses him to influence you into working for him or resisting. During my two play throughs of this episode in choosing both options, I noticed that some of these have very little change to the story while the others have a more impactful change to the storyline. One of these choices made near the end of the episode ends up being not only once of the hardest decisions to make in this entire series, but once of the most heartbreaking. Of course since this episode is set in a dreadful prison, the plot follows Jesse and his friends trying to escape, where they discover that there is one particular prisoner who is the only one who knows the escape route. Referred to as 'Prisoner X', Jesse and his friends must find a way to get to her heavily fortified and guarded cell deep in the prison. based off the choice you made from deciding to work for the Warden or refuse, you will depend on your experience to how you will get yourself to the bottom floor known as the 'Zombie Mines' consisting of all the poor and disgusting prisoners forced to kill and eat zombies. If you decide to work for the Warden, you will promote yourself to working in the room, while if you refuse to, you will find a way to deliberately get yourself into trouble. Once Jesse encounters Prisoner X, Jesse is forced to leave behind one of the series companions; Nurm the Villager and Jacks best frined, or Lluna the Llama the series new animal companion. This choice was both hard and sad to decide because although we hadn't seen these characters that much, what we had seen were strong. Speaking of Stella, we get to see her again where this time she works as an associate and of course has the same bitter & ruthless attitude towards Jesse along with her 'rival' vibe. Some point in the episode, we have the option to let her join us from reasoning with her. if you choose this, than she promises to 'have your back' hopefully in a future episode. And yet again in this episode we are introduced to another cliff hanger though this time it starts during the beginning of the second half of the episode where the admin makes an appearance at the prison bringing back your friend that you chose to retrieve the clock in the previous episode where he tries to force the two of you to fight. After a failed attempt at striking the admin himself, he takes his evil tactics beyond all measures by manipulating Jesse's identity and threatening Beacontown and his older friends. And yet this was all happening when Jesse still has a prison to escape, and once he had, the ending lead to a second cliff hanger!In conclusion, this episode has proven that this season just gets better and better and is the best in the series thanks to all the action, impactful and versatile decisions and consistent cliffhangers which has once again left me very excited for what is to come next.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode-season-two---episode-3-jailhouse-block

But the rush you feel when you escape with one health, enough turns to make it back to the healing station, and just enough junk cards to burn to pour a few tokens into increasing your turn meter to have a few more chances ... it’s almost unrivaled! It will keep you coming back for more punishment and more futile experimentation. After you swear you’ve had enough, everything will somehow click on your “last run” and you’ll feel you’ve finally mastered the alien rascals. And after the credits roll and you’ve gotten a few laughs out of the way, you’ll start up another run to relive the cycle of punishment all over again. And it will be worth it. Loot Rascals isn’t perfect, and its maddening difficulty isn’t for everyone, but it’s as rewarding and fulfilling as the very best roguelikes. Even if you never find success, the quintessentially British humor and lovely art will be enough reward in my opinion.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/loot-rascals

(I give 9.5 score) Earth Atlantis Review - Visual is amazing !! Gameplay concept is interesting. If you love retro space shooters  (R-type, Blood Money, In the hunt, Gradius, steel Empire), buy this game. Graphics - Obviously, the visual is very unique and also very beautiful. It use monochrome pencil-drawing style. When I saw only screenshots, I though it must be very eye-soaring to play this game, but NO, It looks great. I also like the parallax FX on the background. For some reason, It looks even better On handheld mode. Concept - I really love ""Monster-Hunting"" concept. Also, the game has only one large level ""Metroidvania"" style. I think it's s great combination. You have 38 monsters to hunt. In Quest mode, you have to kill some boss to open new locations/areas. Bosses are very different - some are swimming type/ some standing type. Gameplay - This one is tricky. This game is quite challenging . It's definitely just like old retro shooter game on NES/Genesis - people might consider them hard. Some boss are difficult but challenging. You need to carefully learn each boss attacking pattern. You can die easily even on easy setting if you are not careful enough, some boss has one hit-kill attack that might be difficult to some casual player and when you die, you need to upgrade your ship again from O, again just like old games. I will frustrate some casual gamers. It's not ""Dark-Soul"" difficult though. The game have a decent pace. Not as fast as, I thought.  But it will get faster when you use new ships, they are faster than a default one. (I have unlocked 2 more ships so far.) Performance - the game run very well. I have never found any frame-rate drop problem. No glitch found. I've played this game for more than 6 hours (~50% completed) - I really enjoyed it. Conclusion: If you are a retro space-shooter fan (Genesis/NES) - buy this game.

From what I've read of their announcements, I can only see the value of their game increasing and a growing, happy fan-base. The game as is contains mostly basic content that you would expect: gathering resources, building structures, converting peasants into specific laborers/soldiers, fending off attacks, etc. If you enjoy traditional medieval RTS/City-Builder games (the Stronghold series comes to mind) then you will most likely enjoy Kingdoms and Castles. They've already released free, new content with the promise of more on the way.

It achieved its design aims brilliantly , it's truly unique, it's delightful, and it's going to require all of your skill to beat it. It deserves classic status. A gamepad is required to enjoy this game fully. It's the first time in a long time that I've seen a game reinvent the way stick controllers work. The most recent one I can think of was Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, which used the twin sticks to control two characters at once, or perhaps Grow Home/Grow Up's use of the triggers to represent its climbing robot's hands. Snake Pass translates the real movements of a snake to the controller in a remarkably accurate way. If you want to move extra fast, you'll need to move left and right to generate the S-shaped movement. If you want to climb, you'll need to coil around an object, grip it, and keep spiralling your way upwards. It requires a constant handover of energy, as you learn when to grip and when to let go, when to raise yourself by craning your neck and when to swing your heavy head with gravity to throw it forwards instead. Snake Pass is a radically different take on platformers. It's also a physics puzzle, underneath it all. It's also a collect-a-thon, but not in the usual sense. Each object is more like a target you need to reach. Many of them look impossible at first, but you figure out how to manipulate speed, momentum and balance to achieve the grab.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/snake-pass

I must admit that I didn’t expect to enjoy this game as much and the main reason I enjoyed it so much is because it got a lot of the mechanics right. The puzzles which play a massive part in the game are absolutely perfect and the clever design plays a part in each individual puzzle. They have also managed to get the difficulty spot on and by doing this it means you don’t get frustrated very often when taking on the puzzles, which is great. Another important thing in a game like this is the controls and thankfully they remain both fluid and responsive throughout, which means you can focus solely on the tasks at hand without worrying about any problems. I must admit that I was surprised with the amount of content the game offers you and without a doubt you definitely get value for money. There are 75 levels for you tackle and some of them are pretty fun, but I would have liked to have had a little more variety with the level design. I would have also liked to have had a bit more in the way of a story and I think more of a story would have made the gameplay even better. The presentation side of the game pleased me a great deal and it also has the added bonus of stirring up some fond memories, especially when it came to the visuals. The visuals in the game have a real retro look to them and they complement the gameplay ever so well. At the end of the day Fearful Symmetry & The Cursed Prince is definitely a hidden gem. It’s a game that creates a very enjoyable experience and it makes you want to revisit time and time again, which is pretty rare with game’s like this. There is a little bit of everything in the game and this means that Fearful Symmetry will attract a number of different gamers.

Apparently, this series has been going on for 15 years total, but only a couple of the games in the entire series have been localized for North America. This leads to more than a little confusion, as this title is generally regarded more as a fanservice title for long-time fans,  and so a lot of references and occasional plot points fell flat for me. That being said, this is a generally solid SRPG (like Disgaea, as an easy example) with all of the expected quirks, like being able to grind levels and replay previous battles to overlevel your characters. The game doesn't always give you a good explanation of some of the side mechanics for the game, but most of what it's putting out there are simplistic enough that you either don't need them, or you can muddle through without real penalty until you grasp them completely. The voice work ranges from bad to ""ehh..not terrible"", and honestly, there were several conversations that made me laugh out loud. There's some very clever dialogue, if you're willing to go through all of the side conversations. (And there's a ton.) As is typical of a lower-budget game from Japan, only the main plot scenes actually have voice work, while the rest is just text to read while you stare at static pictures of the cast. Also, many conversations just become a giant exposition dump, which can feel a bit tedious. On  the other hand, you have fully animated anime cutscenes at major plot points, which add a real element of quality to the game, and are definitely enjoyable. The art is fairly generic, though some of the character art/designs do stand out. Nothing's really terrible, but again, it feels a lot like a budget game. The gameplay is solid, and the plot is generally captivating, but just like the artwork, it feels like a budget game.  It's not quirky enough to be Disgaea, and it's not serious enough to be Fire Emblem. Overall though, it scratches the itch, and if the game resonates with you, there's a lot of content. 30-ish different endings, a significant amount of side content, and trophies to chase, along with a very generous New Game + mode that really doesn't reset much of your progress. This isn't a slapdash title, and even though it's a port from the Vita, it holds up well enough on the PS4 that it doesn't regularly remind you of the fact. If you've got a spare $20 laying around, you definitely could do far worse.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/summon-night-6-lost-borders

I seriously don't see how anyone couldn't follow the plot or that it was hard to understand what was going on because they weren't a fan of the series... sure it makes reference to past games, and I think maybe the anime, and the characters are mostly past entries in this series, but the plot of this game is not really a continuation, it's just based in the Fate universe with it taking place after Fate/Extra. You can play this as a standalone game and enjoy what it has to offer. I adored the characters, and I thought the plot in terms of the relationship dynamics was executed wonderfully.The gameplay itself is inspired by the Musou series of games (Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, Warriors Orochi), and it does a great job of adding enough original ideas mixed with that style to feel like it's own thing. There could be some improvements, and hopefully, the sequel will fix that, but as hack and slash, 1 vs 1000 game, it does it's job well, and me being a Musou game fan, I loved it. It also doubles as a visual novel/dating type of game too, as you bond with the characters you play as. I like this idea over the Koei Tecmo games because it adds a more human element to the characters you control, I care for the character I play as because I've befriended them and bonded with them through my interactions with them. I just wish there was more than the three charcaters that you could have this interaction with, because I would love to have that same level of interaction with a character like Artoria Pendragon or Elizabeth Bathory, something which again I hope they improve in the sequel. Other than that. Great game. If you like Dynasty Warriors and the various spin-offs (Like Hyrule Warriors and/or Fire Emblem Warriors) you'll probably love this, and with the added visual novel feel with the ""dating"" elements it's probably gonna appeal to the ""waifu/husbando"" lovers out there. And this game is certainly well suited on the Nintendo Switch with the fact that you can take this anywhere and enjoy hack and slash action on the go and on a big TV.

Or at least it's supposed to be, right? You'd be wrong, and here's why: Throughout this episode, the game forces on you this made-up relationship between you and your sister-in-law, Kate, with everyone telling you or implying that they thought you were hooking up with her. And she herself comes on to you soooo strong. All of this even if you make every possible choice to deny having any relationship with her throughout the entire game thus far. It's maddening. Why give me these conversation choices just to completely render them irrelevant? If Telltale really wants that to be part of the story, then they shouldn't have even given us options to try and push for that to NOT be part of the story. I don't want anything to do with Kate. Period. The next issue I have has to do with the contrivances of the writing. In this episode, problems could be solved with another sentence or two being spoken. Instead, characters stay silent. Specifically I'm talking about Javier talking to the leaders in the church about the events leading up to this episode. You, once again, are denied choices. In this case, it's the choice to fully explain yourself and what occurred before-hand. The writing does this because, logically, if he explained himself, the leadership would understand and the game wouldn't progress. So the only ways to force progression are to make the leadership illogical in their actions OR, the choice they went with, force the player-character to keep silent on these issues, even though a few words spoken could save everyone in the game the entirety of the conflict. If this wasn't a game driven PURELY by it's story, it could get away with it, but this is a game that is based entirely around it's writing and characters to carry it. Lastly, the wait between episodes was far too long. I found myself having difficulty remembering all the events of the prior two episodes and, because of this, it becomes nigh impossible to care or become invested in the story and characters. The argument could be that I should have just waited for the game to come out in its entirety, but that defeats the entire purpose of episodic content. A good episodic game allows you to discuss the game with others, get invested in the characters, make predictions about what is going to come next, etc. ""Lost"" for example, was a TV show built on this concept with people constantly discussing the show and making predictions between episodes that kept it fun and exciting even outside of watching the show.  A good episodic game should build up between episodes , getting the player excited to see what's next with the next episode releasing at the peak of excitement. When the wait is too long, the hype builds up and then crumbles, leaving nothing but apathy in its wake. My emotions during this episode ranged from apathy at the events and characters to anger at the forced relationship with Kate that I made very clear through my choices I didn't want. I felt no excitement, no fear, no shock, nothing. The 3/10 I'm giving this game is generous considering its shortcomings.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-3-above-the-law

Essentially, you play simultaneously between two comical, jelly-like characters named Bismo and Plom, who like straight out of a superhero movie, got their abilities in an unfortunate accident. The objective of the game is to shift between each character to solve puzzles, avoid obstacles and platform your way through the many levels in the four distinct stages (The lab, Forest, Grotto and Canyon) and to eventual freedom. The game is broken into two modes, solo and multiplayer. Solo play means you control both of these blobs on your own. You switch between controlling one at time, while also having control over their power to be bigger or smaller, however neither can be the same size at the same time. You are often required to master quite a few skills such as strategically throwing your partner and boxes, changing size mid-air and balancing out pressure platforms. In this game, timing is everything and it can get tedious if your reactions aren’t super quick. Controlling my little blobby pals became finicky, especially if you were required to throw one, then mid-air change to the other character and resize him. Often or not my timing wasn’t quick enough, resulting in a spray of swearing being heard around my room as I had to trudge my character all the way back to the start, to begin again. In the rare moments, you do become stuck on a puzzle (because most are generally quite simple) ,there is little or no indication of what needs to be done, at times leaving me in the fetal position a frustrated, quivering mess mumbling to myself that ‘I am actually smart’. Along the way, you can also collect all 75 coins, beat time trials or find and solve the what I call the elusive ‘Marshmallow’ cube challenge, in each level. Having these collectibles were all well and good but I really had no urge or incentive to replay levels to collect them, and often just ran by them. The only collectible worth tackling was the cube, as it at times really required some thought and was a challenge to acquire.Multiplayer Co-Op is very similar to the story mode gameplay wise, however with different obstacles to conquer. The real value you get from it though is the seer enjoyment you get playing with a friend. It was nice to communicate with someone physically in the same room as me, as we played. It brought back instant memories of my childhood, sitting crossed legged on the carpet with my best friend Lynette playing Mario Cart, laughing, berating and shoving each other, at every in-game decision. This mode has some enticement to collect coins because it was a competition to collect more than your partner. At times, it got down right brutal as you could trigger a size change in your friend at the wrong moment killing them, giving you the opportunity to steal their coins for yourself. Movement with two people playing has such a more natural flow than the solo mode, clearly showing the developers true motives was to invest much of its TLC into its Co-op play. The environments lacked much creative thought and without the obstacles littered in the level, there isn’t much with great detail to look at. The blobs themselves though were quite adorable and memorable...despite being well.. gelatinous blobs. Overall, this is a fairly decent, but often frustrating platformer, when playing by your lonesome.

The game features colorful characters and a lot of balanced units, different terrains, cities creating money when you capture them… Tiny Metal proposes all of this, and not much more. It doesn’t seem the developer ever tried to hide the affiliation to their mentor, the units and mechanics are so close I took more pleasure finding the differences between the two than playing the actual game. It even took the “bad” things Advance Wars has. The story parts take forever, the characters are caricatural and kinda dumb. When units fight each other, the camera zooms in to show the units firing, and in Advance Wars, that’s something I disable after 1 or 2 hours of game. It’s cool to have, but I’d have preferred them to not implement this and improve the game in other ways instead. The camera is shifted a bit on the Y axis, which is really disturbing for a top-down tactical game. The unit designs are too similar, it’s hard to recognize a recon jeep from a tank at a glance, which is bad when you have a lot of units on the battlefield. And when moving your cursor to move a unit, which is something you do most of the time, the tiles highlighted to see where you can go are not visible enough, so sometimes I’m not sure where my unit can go, and there is a sound -- a buzz sound like when you are doing something wrong -- but it’s playing every time you move the cursor to move a unit. Obnoxious. The game’s not bad, but it’s so close to Advance Wars that I’d just recommend playing the latter instead of this indie title.

Other than that no complains and the audio complements the style its going for. There is content here, a variety of maps and they feel big enough. Sometimes a bit hard knowing where the fire is coming from when you are getting shot at, but orienting is fine and no motion sickness here. I had that with EVE : Valkyrie at first. All the characters are interesting and unique (there are 9) and it is suprisingly fun to unlock customizable vanity stuff and mod loadouts. Actually finding those vanity items and equipping them is a bit worse, as you don`t really get an explanation as to what it is; paint job? Dashboard ornament? But a minor annoyance at best. The mods work like a tradeoff. For example Nitrrous : Gain 6 seconds of infinite boost, but add a 6 second cooldown. Or charging your heavy (ultimate ability that charges as you deal and take damage) 50% faster, but your heavy normal weapon deals 50% less. Stuff like that. The balance seems fine so far. For it`s price this is a no-brainer compared to other lackluster VR games.

It's not something I'm particularly well-versed in and such discussions can result in a lot of **** from multiple parties. In my experience, a lot of political agendas in games come off as heavily contrived and are often met player backlash as a result. With Black The Fall, however, I sort of have to get into the politics of the game since it plays a big part in it's striking theme. The game is an indie, puzzle platformer game that's set during the oppressive Communist regime in Romania. Further research turned up that the face of Romania's communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu is displayed on giant TV's throughout the game and you can even find a subtle outline of the country in the main menu, just off to the bottom right of the bike. The game supposedly draws a lot of references to Romania's dark past and provides an interesting ""what if"" scenario regarding the Communist regime not being overthrown in 1989: the end of Nicolae Ceausescu's term as Communist leader. The core gameplay loop revolves around using stealth and puzzle solving solutions to navigate through factory floors, secret passage ways, an abandoned wasteland, a prison complex and ultimately escape. Throughout the game, you'll experience just how far an oppressive regime will to squash any dissenters and maintain order as NPCs are forced fed propaganda and are worked to the point of exhaustion and sickness. I felt that the games graphics were well done. The dark, imposing atmosphere that covers every colour on the grey spectrum do a great job of creating this drab and dreary environment that you want to escape from and never look back. The game also leverages the colour red to indicate security measures, which presents a threat to the player. Funny enough that the colour red has also been associated with Communism (the infamous ""Hammer & Sickle""). The game's runtime on a single play through is about 3 hours with very little replay value. Despite the shorter run time, the game still tells a pretty compelling story about refusing to no longer be a cog in an oppressive regime and plotting an escape. The game has a pretty demoralizing ending, considering everything the player has to go through to get to the end.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/black-the-fall

Therefore, in the results tab, you win by 8s margin.. wtf.. 3. When you finish behind a rider with a very little gap (about 0.070s or less), you still win the battle in the end. It turns up you finish 'ahead' of him by 0.001s or even less (could be exactly 0.000s).

After you seal the world title in the last race of the season, no confirmation even for who is the world champion with how many points, etc.. and worse, you did not get the ""congratulations!"" thing.. it's like nothing happen.. and carry on.. like: ""for the next season, which team you want to?

Or even demote to redbull rookies cup?""

It worsening when i want to hit a corner then suddenly got hit from the inside (even i already close the room in the inside) they still come thru using grass - and then getting me wide, and because we touched, we slowed.. wtf is that?? 13. Still about AI's stupidity. In the straight when there's a CLEAR and EASY chance to pass me, sometimes, they BRAKING INSTEAD! Although i only accidentally block them a bit! They won't take the other line and choose to brake.. 14. Others that need improvement: braking power still too much. In real world a moto3 bike need to brake at about  4-5 seconds, way before entering the first corner in Qatar circuit. But in this game you can brake really close to the corner and brake about 2-3 seconds. Other than that, i like this game because it's the only official game that motogp has..",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/motogp-17

The second thing is that it's a light, fun game. In my opinion, it fully succeeds as a game with this level of scope as its aim. The problem is that it was originally released at £30 (adjust for your own currency), whereas it should be about £10, which is roughly what I paid. At that price it would probably have an extra 10-15 on its metascore. Despite this, I'd almost call it a must-have PSVR game, just because of how good it feels to interact with the game's people and dinos, combined with the relaxed music and general tone. I'd have preferred a game structure that allowed you to keep playing indefinitely, as the game's relaxing nature means I can imagine wanting to play a bit after a hard day at work. In summary, I recommend you pick it up at some point if you have a PSVR, even if you have to wait for a good price (or of course you could pay full price to support the game's developer, just don't expect good value). Also, since it hasn't been mentioned elsewhere and isn't in the demo, I'll add that it has a kind of tower defence mining sub-game that's pretty good and adds a more fast-paced aspect to the game.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/dino-frontier

In the US alone, 3 million of those people will be afflicted with anxiety disorder annually. This illness affects each individual differently; for some, it’s just an uncomfortable feeling during certain events or activities, but for others it’s a crippling fear that makes day to day life unbearable. Either of the scenarios can be brought on by deep seeded trauma that the brain suppresses by blocking out the memory from the subject’s mind. In Nevermind, you’ll take on the role of a doctor that has a device that will allow you to jump inside of patients’ memories and uncover the repressed memory preventing them from moving on with their lives. The game will have you jump into the memories of 5 different subjects, each of whom suffer from various fears that were brought on by past trauma, some of which are coupled with other more prevalent mental disorders. The memories that you will explore are highly detailed mixtures of how they thought the situations played out, mixed with more nightmarish thoughts of how or what caused the memory to be blocked. You’ll need to find a total of 10 photos in each memory, and at their conclusion you’ll piece together what was real, what was imagined, and what order the events occurred in. Along the way you will be tasked with completing some puzzles, which for the most part will simply involve moving or rearranging items in the game world. While they are simplistic in nature, these are well thought out and do occasionally require the player to think outside of the box. The only exception to this is the final puzzle of the game, which requires you to match defaced photos in a specific pattern, which I found to be a bit difficult. The title’s distorted visuals are a high point with its dream state meets nightmare presentation. Many of the environments will twist and distort right in front of your eyes, akin to Layers of Fear, but typically in a much more severe way, almost appearing as an area ripped from Silent Hill. While Nevermind is not an outright horror title, many of the images will haunt you for days after completing the game. The room full of distorted, screaming faces, or the pews lined with rows upon rows of macabre faces that follow you as you navigate the room were much more disturbing than the jump scares that pop up here and there. This game can be played on PC or VR using a heart rate monitor which is supposed to increase or decrease the tension experienced throughout the title utilizing biofeedback. Sadly, I played the version on Xbox One which does not offer these options, so I didn’t get to experience this. Having spent a few hours with the version absent of this feature, I can imagine that this would make it a much tenser affair. Navigation within the world is very accessible, as the controls are extremely basic. You’ll only use a handful of the buttons on a standard gamepad, with the only issue being the movement speed, which runs at a turtle’s pace. While you can take as much time as you want to explore the areas and are not facing any sort of timer, there are occasional areas that can “kill” you if timed incorrectly. Death does not carry much of a penalty outside of warping you to the beginning of the area with your progress intact, but you will get tired of slowly walking back to your destination if death occurs too often. The title does lack replay options, offering only 5 patients to interact with and a handful of more relaxing areas to explore if you so choose. Despite being able to revisit each level to view additional memories which are only available once you complete the levels, these can be viewed from the main terminal in your office after the fact and provide some additional backstory as well as additional achievements for those that care. That being said, completionists will have to complete each level twice to net a 100%. With so many walking sims in the vein of Nevermind on the market, few offer the insight into real disorders like this. Despite its few shortcomings, I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a good, not so threatening option in the horror genre, or to maybe gain some insight into what it is like to suffer from anxiety.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/nevermind

Yet it can be classified as a puzzle game with hints. The good:- pleasant graphics and audio; it's a work of art, not entertainment- some of the puzzles are pretty imaginative The so-so:- the overall feel of pointlessness - that's what the game was actually trying to achieve, since it's about absurdist art. But from a gamer's perspective, it's just a collection of puzzles which aren't really connected with any story - as it should be in this case! After a certain amount of puzzles the game just ends, that's the end of the absurd adventure.- some puzzles are borderline schizophrenic. Without hints they are generally unsolvable. Some other puzzles are too obvious. Dunno, maybe it just depends on the player. At least there are hints. The bad:- the game is very short. I lacked imagination to solve many of the puzzles, so I had to wait for hints to appear (the 1st hint you get after 2 mins, and the second hint after 4 mins).

After 4 hours I thought this game was a gem, a pearl, a treasure. This game is $20 and if you preordered, technically $7 since you got this and the other game for $14.  So all criticisms of the games production and scope will be viewed through that lens.So down the gambit: Visuals are good. Voice acting is good but you do have to read some since this is a $20 indie title (not a drawback for me.) Gameplay is really good, simple, and different from what many are accustomed to. Controls are good except it takes a minute to get used to the real time ""turn"" system which is not actually a turn system. It's hard to explain.  Eventually you figure it out and thus adequately blocking becomes possible (not for some reviewers, geesh, crapping on this whole game because they can't block.)  The lore is actually REALLY good. You have to think about it. You have to read about it in the menu, which for some reason was enjoyable. My FAVORITE part is the writing.  It is highly intelligent and actually had me googling words I've heard maybe once or never in my life. It also had me pondering philosophical concepts in order to properly interpret the foundations of this game's universe, which I love.There is almost a rhythm to the battle system for which ""cooldown"" to hit and when.  The different combatants have different lengths of cooldowns and thus it's a management meta game of how to string together the longest combo to keep your enemy at bay and avoid too much damage.  Enjoyment is further added to this when the ""turn slots"" of this non-turn-system have certain designations where whoever you chose to attack in that slot gets a powered up attack, so you get another level of strategy in this non-RTS-RTS (dont hate lol) and even that is customizable.So that was mostly my thoughts after 4 hours, and after approximately 15 I can't say much has changed.  The only complaint I have is that it gets a little repetitive toward the middle, but honestly what game doesn't?  Almost every AAA game I've played in the last 5 years has been getting you to repeat the same tasks over and over in different locations and with different context.

Add in the fact that there’s an achievement attached to it and you all the motivation in the world to make it dance at least one. Planet of the Eyes is a 2D puzzle platformer where you take control of an unnamed robot that I suspect will probably draw some comparisons to the likes of Wall-E or BD-1. The game starts with a small space shuttle crashing into the ground of an unknown planet. You survive the crash, pop out of the shuttle and discover you’re now stuck on a foreign and hostile world. Not long after that, you come across an audio log, presumable left by your creator, suggesting your explore the planet and hopefully find him. You then proceed to traverse and puzzle solve your way through the world and hopefully reach a satisfying ending. The story is told via audio log narrations that you can collect throughout the game. While there’s no achievement(s) tied to collecting them, the voice over is well done. It strikes a good balance between eerie and cynical. The one aspect of the game that stood out to me the most is the game’s art direction; it’s striking, vibrant and very stylized. The graphics make use of strong, flat colours and simple, subtle gradations with great contrast between the light and dark areas of the game. Along with the use of simple, flat shapes, Planet of the Eyes is a pretty nice game to look at. The core gameplay loop revolves around platforming your way across hazardous areas and solving mostly physics-based puzzles. There are a few times where you’ll also have to evade enemy creatures, but it too is also tied to puzzle solving. There’s the usual trial-and-error moments that come with virtually all games of this genre; one of the platforming puzzles towards the end of the game took several tries for me to finish. While these moments can be marginally frustrating at times, the load times after each death are quite quick and the checkpoint system is pretty forgiving, so I never found myself ascending the slopes of mount rage quit. The mechanics of the puzzles will be familiar to pretty well anybody who has played these types of game before: you push/pull objects, pull levers, time your jumps across platforms, dodge hazardous traps and enemies etc. You can certainly argue that these mechanics are nothing new to genre, but I’d argue when it comes to making good game mechanics and strong and engaging core gameplay loop, the ‘what’ is less important than the ‘how’ and the ‘why’. The mechanics fit the game well, they work as intended and I didn’t come across any game breaking bugs or glitches which can really hamper some physics puzzles. Planet of the Eyes also has some great sound design. The ominous ‘humming’ and ‘droning’ really give off an other-worldly vibe that meshes well with the game’s overall environment. It really helps create a tense and desolate mood for the game. Sound effects for things like bubbling lava, live electrical cables and even your feet clanking against the metal of a destroyed space craft are all well implemented. Overall, I did find some mild enjoyment during my playthrough of Planet of the Eyes. The game has some great art direction, familiar puzzle mechanics and great sound design. A cheap sale price, short play time and a fairly easy 1000G is enough for me to recommend picking this up.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/planet-of-the-eyes

STRAFE has enormous potential. As a kickstarter backer, I can't say I didn't get what I paid for. I can't speak for the optimization issues, as the game runs fine for me, but they have a solid foundation for future balancing. As mentioned elsewhere, it pushes the ""Game of 1996"" look for all its worth and aesthetically, the game absolutely **** and has a pretty kickass soundtrack besides, I'm glad I sprung for that reward tier and am looking forward to getting my music. The guns feel effective and varied. My particular favorite is the disc launcher mode for the railgun, which calls to mind the Ripjack of Unreal fame. Enemies are as dumb as you'd expect from a game meant to be 21 years old, gibs fly everywhere and the ""Murderzone"" mode is pretty great as well, a wave survival mode with persistent upgrades unlocked when you reach certain point milestones. It is also immensely satisfying to successfully complete a run. I noticed by the time I had reached the forth zone that I had started trembling. STRAFE successfully captures the intensity of the 90s shooter, even if it doesn't 100% play like one. That being said, STRAFE goes so hard for capturing the feel of a 90s fps that it incorporates things I really DIDN'T like about them, namely, the blistering difficulty. You also have to look for keycards, but it's immensely downplayed from the old days. Quake 1 was hard, let's not kid ourselves. Mixing that style of gunplay with roguelike level generation should be a no-brainer, but in practice it makes the game harder then it needs to be: Quake wasn't stingy with health, armor and ammo pickups because you absolutely needed them all to succeed. STRAFE, being a roguelike, is by nature incredibly stingy with drops and punishes you for even incidental damage taken, which is incredibly hard to avoid in a game like this. It looks and feels like Quake, but you can't PLAY it like Quake and expect to get very far. Instead, you have to exploit the intentionally stupid AI and funnel enemies into killzones, making it feel more like Half-Life, only considerably less forgiving. You also have to reload, which if nothing else requires you to be a bit pickier with your shots. I am forced to lump STRAFE in the same category of roguelikes as CTHON, Sublevel Zero and Enter the Gungeon, where punishing difficulty is supposed to be an advertised feature instead of a drawback. It's a little more fair then Gungeon, though. I have to go once again on record that I don't dislike hard games outright: Bloodborne, Devil May Cry and of course, Quake are among my favorite games. but I don't believe in using difficulty in place of content, and I think STRAFE suffers from that a bit. You should absolutely give it a try you're at all curious, as it's still an infinitely better purchase then any ""Triple A"" shooters. I just think it could have used some kind of progression system a la UNLOVED or Immortal Redneck, which, I admit, might sound blasphemous to a fan of 90s shooters or 90s games in general. Or at least a difficulty selector. I mean, Quake had one of those.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/strafe

How does that work? Well allow me to explain.Your box character might be a box, but it has full 360 rotation allowing you to move around with ease.You have 2 moves you can use, Slam and Unbox. Slam is used to knock out and destroy enemies while Unbox is a unique mechanic designed specifically to help you get around. You see, your box character is actually made of many boxes inside each other, and each unbox gives you a huge jump boost but also uses one of these boxes inside you which act as your health. This jump boost mechanic allows you to traverse huge distances really quickly, which is needed to get around the extemely large worlds. Speaking of the worlds...There are 3 major worlds and a hub world in this game, technically making 4 areas in total.The hub world only has the collectables in it whereas the 3 major worlds all have mission and secrets aswell. Each world is it's own huge open area with tons of NPC's, missions, collectables and secrets that all ofer something unique and fun. Exploring them is an absolute treat and I only wish there were more. All in all I think Unbox: Newbie's Adventure is a wonderful addition to the growing list of 3D platformer releases this year. There was a clear passion and ambition behind this game and I absolutely love it.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/unbox-newbies-adventure

I don't mean that in the cookie cutter, Hallmark greeting card definition of the word, I truly live for her - she's my single reason for not being a piece of human garbage and waking up each and every morning being thankful I'm alive. With this being said, the story that Stifled immerses the player in really struck a chord with me. You play as David, a character that is slowly losing his mind due to a traumatic event that you will explore through a series of memories; let's face it, no relationship, marriage or otherwise, is perfect all of the time. The game places you in the home of the protagonist as you follow his wife downstairs into the kitchen, only to have her disappear right in front of you. This alone sent shivers down my spine, as this is literally my nightmare painted on a virtual canvas and it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. The loss of a loved one has been a common theme in storytelling for decades, with many games sharing a similar tone, but I haven't felt this invested in finding the missing spouse since Silent Hill 2. The journey you embark on to seek out your missing wife is the main selling point of Stifled, which is highly immersive and well worth the cost of admission, so I won't touch on it anymore to avoid spoilers. The game is a VR title but can be played on a standard TV, which was the sole method this was played for review. Our protagonist is visually challenged, and much like the recent title Perception, you will use sound to create an echo effect to view the world, which will slowly disappear as time progresses. I preferred the black and contrasting colors featured in this opposed to Perception’s take. The kicker is that creating sound will not only paint the picture of the game world for you, but will make you visible to the enemies that wander about the environments. If one additional peripheral option wasn't enough for you, you can use a microphone to use your voice or ambient sound to generate noise as needed, with a controller being an alternative if you prefer to not scream at your TV like a madman. This is something we've seen before in titles such as Alien: Isolation or Manhunt, but works splendidly to create a true sense of dread, and works much better in this title than in previous attempts at the mechanic. As far as horror titles go, most rely on jump scares, exclusively or otherwise. No matter how well placed or animated, they are getting to the point that they are stale and nothing but a cheap scare. Stifled uses absolutely none of these, outside of the occasions that you happen to stumble upon one of the adversaries that inhabit the game world at the wrong time, which I only experienced once during my playthrough. The true terror comes from what you don't see and instead hear, which is pretty much everything. The sound design is spot on, even when using the standard speakers from my mid-grade TV. There are a total of three enemy beings you will encounter on your journey, with the second, a set of twins, being the most troublesome. Sadly, the game suffers with misplaced checkpoints, leaving this portion of the game to be a bit of a slog, ruining what would otherwise be an amazing horror game rivaled only by the genre heavyweights like Resident Evil 7 or Outlast. I found myself terrified of making too much noise and ebbing my way through the encounter as slowly as possible, only to fail even when being completely silent. Honestly, had I not been so invested in the story, I would've given up at this point. At its heart, this is yet another walking simulator, with most of the gameplay requiring you to explore the game world, interact with specific items, and evade the enemies I previously mentioned. It can be completed in just a few short hours, and I don't foresee myself wanting to jump back into it unless I acquire a VR headset. If you have a VR headset (I can only imagine this being one of the more engaging titles on the market) or are a fan of horror titles in general, you have no excuse to not purchase Stifled immediately.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/stifled

It does have single player but when you play on your own it gets boring almost instantly and the AI is very lacklustre and not very smart at all, which does makes things become frustrating. The gameplay on the whole has been done very well, and the best thing is that it remains responsive and fluid throughout. They have also thrown in a few unique ideas when it comes to the Godheads you can use, and I must admit that I appreciated the amount of variety the different characters had. In terms of modes the game doesn’t offer much so the replay value in the game is quite low. Some of the modes are also not good enough and I especially found this to be the case when I was tackling the boring trials mode. The presentation side of the game was something I was very fond of. Visually I loved the wacky art style and the sound design in a way makes you enjoy the game a little more, which is great. At the end of the day Oh My Godheads could have given you a lot more and if it did then the game would have got a much higher score from me. Fans of local multiplayers will find some enjoyment here and it does get some of the basics right, but unfortunately any fun is short-lived because there just isn’t enough depth to the game. I can’t unfortunately fully recommend Oh My Godheads to you because there are better game’s in the genre for a cheaper price, so I would wait until the price drops before you give this game a go.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/oh-my-godheads

While some poor imitations have popped up through the years, no one has been able to capture what made Twisted Metal such a joy to play, nor  have they matched its success. Can Auto Age: Standoff fill that void, or is it another knock off that’s going to crash and burn? The answer to both is kind of. The game’s narrative is brief and consists of a power struggle between Val Vega and the dastardly Dark Jaw, which is explained via a short intro video prior to loading the game. Between missions there is some chatter between the characters, but nothing noteworthy that added to my experience. With so much effort going into making this feel like a nod to GI Joe and other cartoons from the time, Joe’s omission (for obvious reasons) makes the game feel unfinished. While you can play solo with bots or split screen with another human counterpart, the bulk of your time with the offering will be spent with the online community, was next to non-existent before release (outside of the set online times). I feel like an arcade or ladder mode with a proper story would have been a huge improvement to making this seem like a complete package. With only four stages and a handful of modes being offered, there is a severe lack of content here. The cel-shaded graphics that accompany the game suit the storywell. As a huge fan of this style, it was the one thing that kept me interested. The only aspect of the presentation I was turned off by was the music. While I found the synth music a great callback to the 80’s, it quickly grated on my nerves and was promptly turned off before I was forced to stab myself in the ears with sporks. The combat itself is fun and frantic; I especially enjoyed the rush I got when interrupting a battle between other combatants and taking them both out at the last second. However, it quickly became stale due to the barebones content. At launch, the game featured four stages, a few game modes, and a limited number of vehicles to choose from. You’ll see all that this game has to offer in a few hours, if not less. While you can modify the vehicles to reflect paint schemes from either faction as well as its loadout, I found myself struggling to find a good balance and going back to the default offerings. While only four maps are offered, they are designed well for the game modes featured. There are plenty of areas to hide and wait for the right time to pounce on your enemies or interrupt a battle in progress, as well as places to set up traps if playing a team based mode. You’ll also find hidden power-ups and repair pick-ups scattered about the level. While not always a necessity, since the vehicles are fairly well equipped, these can turn the tide of battle. The controls are responsive and feel natural, with controller support being a preference. One thing to note if you plan on playing on a TV opposed to a monitor: you cannot navigate the menus with a controller, which means you will have to keep going to your setup to make changes or initiate a new game between rounds. This was only a mild inconvenience; and let’s be honest, I can use the exercise. Your experience with Auto Age: Standoff is going to depend on the availability of other players online, or if you have friends wanting to play. While games are auto filled with bots if legit players are unavailable, their AI is lacking and often would drive into walls or completely ignore me. You can also play locally in a split screen mode. I can confirm the game did suffer some minor hiccups in the frame rate when stuff really hit the fan on both screens, but ran well overall. With the Twisted Metal franchise on hold, I would recommend this title above other similar options for a few hours of mindless fun.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/auto-age-standoff

Maaybe missing a super-catchy pop song in there. Nice casual story that doesn't take itself too seriously, which I really enjoyed. I found the voice acting to be completely satisfactory. To summarize: + Great controls + Great platforming + Cool puzzles + Difficulty + Cheap+ High quality music+ Looks amazing+ Chill story that doesn't take itself too seriously- A little bit short- Moar puzzles- Buff jump-and-stomp attack. Needs bigger AOE!- Minor fps-drops in the last area, though I have a potato for a pc.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/skylar-plux-adventure-on-clover-island

Thankfully this version does have a few things going for it, but unfortunately it also has a few too many problems which does make it difficult to get fully invested into the game. One of my favourite things about the game was definitely the story, and in my opinion it’s a fantastic story which remains gripping and interesting throughout. Unfortunately though the game does suffer with quite a few technical issues throughout and this does make the story less immersive, which is a shame because the story is so good. The atmosphere does help to combat the technichal issues and sometimes you will forget about them because the creepy atmosphere keeps you glued to the screen, but in the end you still notice the issues. The gameplay is a bit hit and miss, but on the whole the puzzles have been done really well and I found the controls to be responsive most of the time. My only real problem with the gameplay was the hideous camera, and the awkwardness caused a lot of frustration where there didn’t need to be any. I also became frustrated with the amount of loading screens that are dotted everywhere. I wouldn’t have minded as much if the loading screens were quick, but unfortunately they seem to go on forever and it can harm the rhythm of the game. The presentation side of the game is something that I really enjoyed, especially when it came to the sound design. The voice actors have done a fantastic job making the story even more believable and they make you connect with the story even more. The visuals are pretty decent as well, but I would have liked them to have made the game a little brighter. At the end of the day I must admit that when everything was said and done I was a little disappointed with this version of Black Mirror. Don’t get me wrong it does have some very good things going for it, but for the price the game is currently at I would have liked the problems to have been fewer. As it stands at the moment I can’t fully recommend Black Mirror, but once it reduces in price and has a patch or two then it may be worth purchasing.",https://metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/black-mirror

Não consigo enumerar a quantidade de vezes em que fui ao fliperama jogar Joe & Mac, ou os famosos Caveman NINJAS, justamente por ser cativante tanto o seu formato grotesco quanto os inimigos principais que sempre me cativaram. Agora o Nintendo Switch ganha uma versão mais jovial de Joe & Mac, chegando à eShop via JanduSoft. Aqui, a narrativa vai um bocado além do que vimos no clássico dos fliperamas. Enquanto lá haviam dois personagens, aqui temos à nossa disposição cerca de 4 personagens cujos nomes são: Jack, Liliana, Moe e Brienne. Cada um com sua particularidade em seus ataques e estilos de estratégia para sobrevivência. Exemplo disto é uma das personagens que atira lanças que podem servir como plataforma para subirmos em locais mais altos, enquanto isso temos uma mulher totalmente musculosa onde seus danos são muito mais intenso. De posse desses 4 personagens, temos uma narrativa que se desenvolve através do rapto de seus filhos por um extraterrestre, então nossa missão é resgatá-los. O jogo começa com a escolha da personagem, mas podemos trocá-los através do L e R a qualquer momento. Isso fará com que o jogo se torne um pouco mais dinâmico e consequentemente menos marasmático. Durante a jogatina, os cenários pelos quais passamos são interessantes e no mínimo bonitos. A trilha sonora também é bem diversificada e deixa o jogo mais do que interessante, afinal a trilha sonora também tem de ser um ponto positivo para a imersão durante a experiência. O título permite até 4 jogadores multiplayer em modo cooperativo offline e isso me fez recordar imediatamente do jogo Vendetta, título do início dos anos 90 da Konami. Caveman Warriors possui um balanceamento interessante e a dificuldade não é tão plena, mas engana-se ao pensar que será simples passar por alguns cenários. Os mesmos possuem mínimos puzzles a serem resolvidos, coisa bem simples e os chefes de fase são complexos e exigem o mínimo de destreza. Esses puzzles por exemplo são determinadas partes do mapa que exigem a habilidade de um certo personagem que sem ele jamais passaríamos de fase. Ativar a lança de Liliana por exemplo e como já citado permitirá que alcancemos locais mais altos, enquanto o macaco de Joe irá distrair os inimigos, inclusive os chefes de fase para conseguirmos o mínimo de sucesso. De qualquer modo, os inimigos à nossa frente não são grandes coisas. Facilmente morrem com um ataque ou outro enquanto os boss são um pé no saco, inclusive o primeiro. Certamente o que irá lhe frustrar são os controles. Não funcionam com exatidão principalmente quando a questão é a taxa de resposta. Parece que para executar uma ação qualquer leva quase que 0,5ms para que o jogo execute a função. Isso é frustrante simplesmente por termos morrido diversas vezes justamente por darmos de cara com um inimigo e não conseguir matá-lo de imediato como gostaríamos. O VEREDITO Caveman Warriors é um bom jogo e bastante simplista com uma temática arcaica. Não é o melhor jogo para Switch, mas certamente é uma linda homenagem para com Joe & Mac, que foi eternizado por ser simples e carismático à sua moda.",https://metacritic.com/game/switch/caveman-warriors

The story is compelling, the puzzles are creative, and it just gives me that same feeling that the previous Syberia games gave me. So, I've probably played a good chunk of this game now. I had my expectations set low, as I didn't really know how this game would turn out. Before playing it, I thought it would be another tacked-on sequel, with no new ideas or personality. I was pleasantly surprised. The game follows Kate Walker, after being ditched by Voralburg. She's on the run after not returning the contract for the Voralburg factory, with accusations of embezzlement. However, she has the Yukals on her side on her journey. About controls: they have changed since the first game. Don't get me wrong: this is still a point-&-click, but movement is controlled using the arrow keys. I guess you could say it's slightly clunky, but it works. I personally think that the graphics are quite nice, however, that could be subjective. Some parts definitely look better than others, and I actually prefer the in-engine cutscenes to the pre-rendered ones. The graphics aren't any different to the trailers, so you can probably make judgement based on that. Puzzles and story is where this game really shines. The story does a great job at continuing the adventure: and adventure there is. I've already experienced some plot-twists I've never saw coming, and I feel that the pacing is quite good. The puzzles are similar to the previous games, if not slightly easier (which is welcome to me, as I found the previous games pretty difficult). The only criticism I would say is at the beginning, the game sets you down a narrow path. If you find an item, sometimes you cannot get it until someone points it out to you. This is pretty frustrating. Overall though, this game feels like a Syberia game, and gets the tone right. A couple of technical issues are there, but they have not made me enjoy this game any less.",https://metacritic.com/game/pc/syberia-3

I can safely say that this is a well thought out, and produced 2-D throwback game that, if given the time to learn, (This is nearly Dark Souls hard, and you will have to learn the game to find fun and success in it.) Graphics: While these aren't OMG so realistic 3-D skin with bloom and brown colors so realism graphics, clearly time was spent trying to both match the style of Double Dragon 2 for the NES, and add onto it with new animations and characters and areas. Controls: Not only can you use standards such as Steam, PS4, and Xbox 360 controllers automatically, but I found that with little effort I could use my USB SNES controller adaptor perfectly with no issues which most games would require a 3rd party program such as Joy2Key. A small detail, but it's the thought that counts. Gameplay: This is no pushover by far, and players will have to die ALOT in order to understand not just to push buttons to do moves and win, but use the techniques correctly to counter the very smart A.I. who will anticipate your moves, and counter back at you as well as gang up on you. Smart countering and crowd control is rewarded with energetic fights throwing around groups of enemies at a time while staying on your toes. There is also challenging platforming, and a wealth of replay value including an unlockable Tower Mode, and more. Sound: Included is a modern remake Soundtrack as well as a selectable Retro Soundtrack with all the old retro sound effects from the original games, and are crisp and clear and sound great. Story: There is a small, very 80's video game storyline here to be followed as players complete levels. It ain't Shakespeare, but it's fun, and its follows the original game lore, which is nice. Overall: Arc Systems Works buying, and releasing of old, beloved Gaming IP's has been always had alot of care into recreating and adding upon has continued in this release, and if you are a 2-D gaming fan, or someone who is wondering what all the fuss about retro gaming is you will be rewarded with a surprisingly deep game, (if you spend more than 5 minutes with it.), which emphasizes action-based technical gameplay as opposed to the Plain Jane Shooty McBangBangs that have overrun the modern gaming landscape with non-skippable 30 minute cutscenes followed by 2 seconds of gameplay.

Unfortunately, you have to unlock a certain number of extras to proceed, and the map does not show you the requirements until you drive to the marker to start the mission. This lead me on a wild goose chase multiple times looking for the next mission so I could move on with my current build. The game is quite buggy, and I was subject to a large number of glitches ranging from invisible walls to being catapulted for no reason. The game often seemed to forget that I had died and left me to watch my rider lay on the pavement, forcing me to restart the event. Respawns are also an issue at times, as the game will drop you into the world from a highly elevated point, at which point you explode; this happened repeatedly in some instances. The game’s visuals are on par with most late PS2/early PS3 games, and do not take advantage of the current-gen hardware in any obvious way. With a lot of texture popping and clipping, as well as a grey tone that’s washed over everything, Road Rage is kind of ugly to look at. Additionally, the character models are very static. You’ll sit on your bike with your weapon always at your side, and even when taking sharp turns, your rider never moves, almost like it’s an action figure stuck to an RC toy. The only exception to this is when you collide with certain obstacles in the game, which is weird because some that would result in certain death are ignored (if not driven through), and others that shouldn’t cause issue send you flying, as if you’re playing the Insurance Fraud mini-game from Saint’s Row. The sound design isn’t much better, featuring a synch rock techno-ish soundtrack from the 90’s as well as boorish, poorly acted voice overs. Since the text pushing the story forward is displayed in a group text chat format (yeah, that annoying thing your mother or most annoying friend does), I found myself cranking my own heavy metal music and skipping the sound all together fairly early into my time with the title. The controls and AI don’t fare much better, as the other riders will regularly veer off and slam into buildings for no good reason, which makes losing pretty difficult. Your worst adversary is going to be the controls, which most of the time feel as if you pushed the button to turn or brake 5+ seconds before the game reacts. This is less of an issue when you are the only racer on the screen; however, when 6 or so racers are present, with the open world atmosphere, the game barely runs at 30FPS and the aforementioned issue becomes more of a serious problem. The only remedy I found for this was to get ahead and stay there, which actually makes for a decent racing experience. The combat, which you’d think would be at the forefront of the game, is also awkward. When you get within range of another racer, you’ll hit a button that will enter combat mode, which serves as an auto-aim like feature that conveniently pulls you closer to the racer and allows you to take a few swings at them. Due to the nature of the poor physics engine, this is a mess as well, since you or the racer you want to attack will likely hit another racer, invisible wall, or something from the game world, ending the battle before it even started. The sheer chaos this brings when in a large group is good for a laugh, but not much else. For more details, you can read the full review at Garage Band Gamers.",https://metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/road-rage
