Graphics are great, done by people with some good sense of game art and are really pushing the capabilities of GBA; Compared to the first game graphics are even more polished and added character animations help bringing even more life into characters. One thing i especially like in the series is that choosing different summon not only changes the gameplay a bit and story but also gives a different feeling to the whole experience. Sword-crafting is well executed and helps differentiating it from other games even more. Sounds and music are not too shabby either. While it may not be the most original and blockbusting game it's definitely a very enjoyable and very strong tittle still bringing a lot of originality into the rpg field which isn't only a gimmick but well built mechanics, although i'd say that storytelling is really where the game excels at  maybe not the story itself but the way it's told hence ""storytelling"" ).Objectively saying i'd give that game 8.5 but choosing between 8 and 9 i have to go with 9  because of personal bias and because of the platform it was released for.  The first game  i'd rate 8.2/8.3  but both titles are imho a must-play, especially if you're into jrpg ",https://metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/summon-night-swordcraft-story-2

There isn't a slider to adjust how good the goalies play this year either which is pretty annoying. When a penalty is called now, 90% of the time it's for high sticking. It's cool that the offenses actually happen, but they could have played this game for about 10 minutes and seen the number of high sticking penalties was ridiculous.

Anyone screaming that the level of uber-'murica patriotism is sickening needs to realize that this game came from a UK company and this is without a doubt satire to-the-max. As far as the gameplay goes, it appears to be the typical run-and-gun on the surface, but goes slightly deeper than that.  A wide range of weapons from two dynamically different groups, ranging from high tech firearms to lower tech cleavers to your trusty riot shield (which will endlessly save your hind-end) ensure plenty of options to dispatch your enemies.  While kill 'em all is always the easiest way to clean up the streets, some optional objectives call for less-than-lethal results. And these optional objectives, as well as numerous difficulty levels, offer different rewards in the form of new weaponry, equipment and other various perks.  And to me, this is where the replay value holds.  On one level and difficulty setting alone, one optional objective may be to run the level in X:XX time, while another calls for X headshots and another calls for the non-lethal pacification of the gang's leader.   Many times this alone may take several runs through.  Up the difficulty and you get a new set of objectives along with more aggressive enemies.  I am by no means a completionist, but I felt compelled to replay each level until I met every objective.  The only modern game that had this type of feel, in my opinion, was The Club; but that game fell short. Graphics, by the old Xbox standards for pretty fair to good.  Music in the menus is a bit repetitive but tolerable.  Voice acting, well, it fits the campy, satirical nature of the game, so no complaints there. In all honesty, this game is the only reason I've held on to my old Xbox.

After commandeering a handful of rockets to rescue her, they've wound up on a strange (and sometimes scary) adventure through outer space. Now players must rescue both their classmates AND their teacher – and just maybe the whole solar system while they’re at it. Explore strange planets. Players see the sights of this strange, sci-fi fantasy setting as they uncover the secret behind their teacher's disappearance in this epic role-playing game. The stylus controls everything, from combat to conversations to outfitting allies. Simple controls make it easy to play but a challenge to master. Players can link up wirelessly with five friends and explore the amigo dungeon together – they'll find unending challenges and incredible rewards as they delve into the depths of this unique multiplayer experience. Madeleine, a respected and powerful teacher at Will O'Wisp magical academy, tells her students that she will undertake a dangerous mission in space and trains them for combat should the need arise. After not hearing from her for some time, the kids stumble upon a hangar of rocket ships. One by one, they board individual ships and crash land on distant planets alone. Players hop from planet to planet assembling the group of classmates. Once together, they learn of an evil sorcerer – a former student of the academy who now has ambitions to destroy reality – and set out to stop him. The game’s combat plays like a traditional role-playing game. The difference comes from the command wheel and the stylus interface. Players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. The game focuses on magic attacks: Each character has a ""sign"" linked to one of the planets that determines the type of magic he or she uses. As the planets move through the solar system, the effectiveness of magic spells shifts, requiring an ever-changing battle plan: Monsters and characters grow stronger as their planets shift into prominence and weaker as they move out of those positions. Players can check the planets' positions by tapping on the astrolog. [Nintendo]",https://metacritic.com/game/ds/magical-starsign

The game provides mass-scale battles between thousands-strong armies of the nations involved in conflicts during this period. The theatres of operation introduce France, Britain, Austria, Russia, Prussia, Egypt and three nations not represented in the original game – Spain, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw (Poland) and the Confederation of the Rhine. The developers did their best to reconstruct the largest battles and historical events of the Napoleonic wars. The game reconstructs in detail the soldiers' uniforms, weapons and architecture of each nation. Each nation's army has its unique units and possibilities. The game includes over 180 units, 190 buildings, and 1200 flora and fauna elements. When developing the combat system, the peculiarities of early 19th century warring were taken into account, as was the value of formations, provisions and troop morale. Tactical tricks utilized by military commanders of the time are fully reflected in the game. An ""honest"" system of bullet and cannonball ballistics, based on physics, is an innovative addition to the Cossacks engine.

This includes the unique 'Team Battle' mode, which doesn't utilize the traditional first, second and third place finishes. Players win the race by depleting their rival's Spirit Points, which are decreased by contact with walls, cars and by falling behind other racers. Divided into 15 areas, two teams compete to dominate the game map through individual races between the different players. By earning points for each victory, players can judge how they stack up against their rivals and cherry-pick their competition from the player roster as they look to seize territories. Win and increase team loyalty, recruit defeated riders and increase your supremacy on the streets while being upgraded in the rankings. But lose, and learn quickly that there are no points for second place in street racing.

The game's authentically modeled Nissans, Mitsubishis and Subarus can all be enhanced with new exhausts, paint jobs and spoilers.
